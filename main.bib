These processes involve transport in a lattice which is in some sense random, and in them diffusion is expected to take place via quantum jumps between localized sites. In this simple model the essential randomness is introduced by requiring the energy to vary randomly from site to site. It is shown that at low enough densities no diffusion at all can take place, and the criteria for transport to occur are given.},

We use advanced cluster algorithms to avoid the critical slowing down. We first check the validity of the relation connecting the critical behavior of the LR model with parameters (d,{$\sigma$}) to that of a short-range (SR) model in an equivalent dimension D. We then study the critical behavior of the d=2 LR model close to the lower critical {$\sigma$}, uncovering that the spatial correlation function decays with two different power laws: The effect of the subdominant power law is much stronger than finite-size effects and actually makes the estimate of critical exponents very subtle. By including this subdominant power law, the numerical data are consistent with the standard renormalization group (RG) prediction by Sak [Phys. Rev. B 8, 281 (1973)], thus making not necessary (and unlikely, according to Occam's razor) the recent proposal by Picco [arXiv:1207.1018] of having a new set of RG fixed points in addition to the mean-field one and the SR one.},

In these, the effect of spatially extended degrees of freedom is usually only taken into account in a mean field fashion or as a secondary effect.

Here we demonstrate that diagrammatic multiscale methods anchored around local approximations are indeed capable of capturing the non-mean-field nature of the critical point of the lattice model encoded in a nonvanishing anomalous dimension and of correctly describing the transition to mean-field-like behavior as the number of spatial dimensions increases.},

Despite the fact that the interplay of these two routes to a vanishing conductivity has been a central research topic, a unifying picture has not emerged so far. Here, we establish that the two-dimensional Falicov-Kimball model, one of the simplest lattice models of strong electron correlation, does allow for the study of this interplay. In particular, we show that this model at particle-hole symmetry possesses three distinct thermodynamic insulating phases and exhibits Anderson localization. The previously reported metallic phase is identified as a finite-size feature due to the presence of weak localization. We characterize these phases by their electronic density of states, staggered occupation, conductivity, and the generalized inverse participation ratio. The implications of our findings for other strongly correlated systems are discussed.},

  abstract = {The distribution functionP L (s) of the local order parameters in finite blocks of linear dimensionL is studied for Ising lattices of dimensionalityd=2, 3 and 4. Apart from the case where the block is a subsystem of an infinite lattice, also the distribution in finite systems with free [P L (f) (s)] and periodic [P L (p)(s) ] boundary conditions is treated. Above the critical pointT c , these distributions tend for largeL towards the same gaussian distribution centered around zero block magnetization, while belowT c these distributions tend towards two gaussians centered at {$\pm$}M, whereM is the spontaneous magnetization appearing in the infinite systems. However, belowT c the wings of the distribution at small |s| are distinctly nongaussian, reflecting two-phase coexistence. Hence the distribution functions can be used to obtain the interface tension between ordered phases.At criticality, the distribution functions tend for largeL towards scaled universal forms, though dependent on the boundary conditions. These scaling functions are estimated from Monte Carlo simulations. For subsystem-blocks, good agreement with previous renormalization group work of Bruce is obtained.As an application, it is shown that Monte Carlo studies of critical phenomena can be improved in several ways using these distribution functions:(i) standard estimates of order parameter, susceptibility, interface tension are improved(ii) T c can be estimated independent of critical exponent estimates(iii) A Monte Carlo ``renormalization group'' similar to Nightingale's phenomenological renormalization is proposed, which yields fairly accurate exponent estimates with rather moderate effort(iv) Information on coarse-grained hamiltonians can be gained, which is particularly interesting if the method is extended to more general Hamiltonians.},

In particular, we consider in detail a class of slowly varying potential with a typical example being Vn={$\lambda$} cos({$\pi\alpha$}n{$\nu$}) with 0{$<\nu<$}1. We develop an asymptotic semiclassical technique to calculate exactly (in the large-n limit) the density of states and the Lyapunov exponent for this model. We also carry out numerical work involving direct diagonalization and recursive transfer-matrix calculations to study localization properties of the model. Our theoretical results are essentially in exact agreement with the numerical results. Our most important finding is that, for {$\lambda<$}2, there is a metal-insulator transition in this one-dimensional model ({$\nu<$}1) with the mobility edges located at energies Ec={$\pm\Vert$}2-{$\lambda\Vert$}. Eigenstates at the band center ({$\Vert$}E{$\Vert<\Vert$}Ec{$\Vert$}) are all extended whereas the band-edge states ({$\Vert$}E{$\Vert>\Vert$}Ec{$\Vert$}) are all localized. Another interesting finding is that, in contrast to higher-dimensional random-disorder situations, the density of states, D(E), in this model is not necessarily smooth through the mobility edge, but may diverge according to D(E){$\sim\Vert$}E-Ec{$\parallel-\delta$}. The Lyapunov exponent {$\gamma$} (or, the inverse localization length) behaves at Ec as {$\gamma$}(E){$\sim\Vert$}E-Ec{$\parallel\beta$}, with {$\beta$}=1-{$\delta$}. We solve the exact critical behavior of the general model, deriving analytic expressions for D(E), {$\gamma$}(E), and the exponents {$\delta$} and {$\beta$}. We find that {$\lambda$}, {$\alpha$}, and {$\nu$} are all irrelevant variables in the renormalization-group sense for the localization critical properties of the model.

Many important theoretical results are examined that show the absence of Fermi-liquid features and provide a detailed description of the static and dynamic correlation functions and of transport properties. The parameter space is rich and one finds a variety of many-body features like metal-insulator transitions, classical valence fluctuating transitions, metamagnetic transitions, charge-density-wave order-disorder transitions, and phase separation.

  abstract = {The Falicov-Kimball model is a simplified version of the the Hubbard model in which only one type of electron (e.g. spin down) is allowed to hop. It describes in particular a system of spinless quantum particles interacting with classical particles (Ising spins). In this review we present the progress which has been accomplished in the last decade concerning this model, with an emphasis on rigorous results. Our discussion includes the one, two, and three dimensional cases. We also show how certain techniques can be applied to other related models such as the static Holstein and Kondo models. Their common feature with the Falicov-Kimball model is that they consist of itinerant spinless electrons interacting with a classical field, associated with either a discrete Ising spin, a continuous scalar spin or a vector field. Finally we discuss a generalized Falicov-Kimball model of spin one-half electrons with on-site Hubbard interaction and interacting also with classical particles, as well as different models where the fermions are replaced by hard-core bosons. For the last class of models the interactions are truly many body but a limited number of rigorous results can be obtained using reflection positivity. The main issues discussed in this review concern the structure of ground states for the classical particles, and how they are affected by magnetic fluxes (via orbital coupling) and quantum statistics. Perturbative as well as non perturbative methods are used.},

Although the model can be analyzed using free-fermion techniques, it has dynamical signatures in common with typical many-body localized systems: Starting from generic initial states, entanglement grows logarithmically; in addition, equilibrium dynamical correlation functions decay with an exponent that varies continuously with temperature and model parameters. These quasi-1D models offer an experimentally realizable setting in which natural dynamical probes show signatures of disorder-free many-body localization.},

As in the case of single-site dynamical mean field theory, thermalization is absent in DCA simulations, and for quenches across the metal-insulator boundary, nearest-neighbor charge correlations in the nonthermal steady state are found to be larger than in the thermal state with identical energy. We investigate to what extent it is possible to define an effective temperature of the trapped state after a quench. Based on the ratio between the lesser and retarded Green's function we conclude that a roughly thermal distribution is reached within the energy intervals corresponding to the momentum-patch dependent subbands of the spectral function. The effectively different chemical potentials of these distributions however lead to a very hot, or even negative, effective temperature in the energy intervals between these subbands.},

The results show a reduction of the light-cone velocity with interaction strength at low temperature, while the phase velocity increases. At higher temperature, the initial spreading is determined by the Fermi velocity of the noninteracting system and the maximum range of the correlations decreases with increasing interaction strength. Charge order correlations in the disorder potential enhance the range of the correlations. We also use the numerically exact lattice Monte Carlo results to benchmark the accuracy of equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamical cluster approximation calculations. It is shown that the bias introduced by the mapping to a periodized cluster is substantial, and that from a numerical point of view, it is more efficient to simulate the lattice model directly.},

(It can be viewed as a modified Hubbard model in which the spin-up electrons are not allowed to hop.) The electron-nucleus potential is ``on-site'' only. Neither this potential alone nor the kinetic energy alone can produce long range order. Thus, if long range order exists in this model it must come from an exchange mechanism. N, the electron plus nucleus number, is taken to be less than or equal to the number of lattice sites. We prove the following: (i) For all dimensions, d, the ground state has long range order; in fact it is a perfect crystal with spacing {$\surd$}2 times the lattice spacing. A gap in the ground state energy always exists at the half-filled band point (N = number of lattice sites). (ii) For small, positive temperature, T, the ordering persists when d {$\geqslant$} 2. If T is large there is no long range order and there is exponential clustering of all correlation functions.},

  abstract = {The venerable phenomena of Anderson localization, along with the much more recent many-body localization, both depend crucially on the presence of disorder. The latter enters either in the form of quenched disorder in the parameters of the Hamiltonian, or through a special choice of a disordered initial state. Here, we present a model with localization arising in a very simple, completely translationally invariant quantum model, with only local interactions between spins and fermions. By identifying an extensive set of conserved quantities, we show that the system generates purely dynamically its own disorder, which gives rise to localization of fermionic degrees of freedom. Our work gives an answer to a decades old question whether quenched disorder is a necessary condition for localization. It also offers new insights into the physics of many-body localization, lattice gauge theories, and quantum disentangled liquids.},

  abstract = {We study quantum quenches in two-dimensional lattice gauge theories with fermions coupled to dynamical \$\textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ gauge fields. Through the identification of an extensive set of conserved quantities, we propose a generic mechanism of charge localization in the absence of quenched disorder both in the Hamiltonian and in the initial states. We provide diagnostics of this localization through a set of experimentally relevant dynamical measures, entanglement measures, as well as spectral properties of the model. One of the defining features of the models that we study is a binary nature of emergent disorder, related to \$\textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ degrees of freedom. This results in a qualitatively different behaviour in the strong disorder limit compared to typically studied models of localization. For example it gives rise to a possibility of a delocalization transition via a mechanism of quantum percolation in dimensions higher than 1D. We highlight the importance of our general phenomenology to questions related to dynamics of defects in Kitaev's toric code, and to quantum quenches in Hubbard models. While the simplest models we consider are effectively non-interacting, we also include interactions leading to many-body localization-like logarithmic entanglement growth. Finally, we consider effects of interactions that generate dynamics for conserved charges, which gives rise to only transient localization behaviour, or quasi-many-body-localization.},

The method is to estimate and sum the relevant autocorrelation functions, which is argued to produce more certain error estimates than binning techniques and hence to help toward a better exploitation of expensive simulations. An effective integrated autocorrelation time is computed which is suitable to benchmark efficiencies of simulation algorithms with regard to specific observables of interest. A Matlab code is offered for download that implements the method. It can also combine independent runs (replica) allowing to judge their consistency.},

At the same time it is shown that the Fr\"ohlich-Nabarro interaction is included in the Ruderman-Kittel result as one component. The electronic g-value of Mn ions and the Knight shift of the Cu-nuclei are also discussed from this point of view.},

  abstract = {The ground-state density of states of the half-filled Falicov-Kimball model contains a charge-density-wave gap. At finite temperature, this gap is not immediately closed, but is rather filled in by subgap states. For a specific combination of parameters, this leads to a stable phase where the system is in an ordered charge-density-wave phase, but there is high density of states at the Fermi level. We show that this property can be, in finite dimensions, traced to a crossing of sharp states resulting from the single particle excitations of the localized subsystem. The analysis of the inverse participation ratio points to a strong localization in the discussed regime. However, the pronounced subgap density of states can still lead to a notable increase of charge transport through a finite size system. We show this by focusing on the transmission in heterostructures where a Falicov-Kimball system is sandwiched between two metallic leads.},
