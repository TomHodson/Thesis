magnetic field Hamiltonian was probably wrong for the HLM

we don't need magnetic field results for amorphous
maybe don't need field free results for HLM?

Might want to just compare magnetic field HLM + no field amo
and we can implement the magnetic field term for HLM by hand
to ensure it is correct.
