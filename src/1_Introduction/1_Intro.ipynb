    "When you take many objects and let them interact together, it is often simpler to describe the behaviour of the group differently than one would describe the individual objects. Consider a flock (technically called a _murmuration_) of starlings like +@fig:Studland_Starlings. Watching the flock you'll see that it has a distinct outline, that waves of density will sometimes propagate through the closely packed birds and that the flock seems to respond to predators as a distinct object. The natural description of this phenomena is couched in terms of the flock rather than the individual birds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The behaviours of the flock are an emergent phenomena. The starlings are only interacting with their immediate six or seven neighbours [@king2012murmurations; @balleriniInteractionRulingAnimal2008]. This is what a physicist would call a _local interaction_. There is much philosophical debate about how exactly to define emergence [@andersonMoreDifferent1972; @kivelsonDefiningEmergencePhysics2016] but for our purposes it enough to say that emergence is the fact that the aggregate behaviour of many interacting objects may be very different from the individual behaviour of those objects. \n",

    "Condensed Matter is, at its heart, the study of what behaviours emerge from large numbers of interacting quantum objects at low energy. When these three properties are present together: a large number of objects, those objects being quantum and there are interaction between the objects, we call it an interacting quantum many body system. From these three ingredients nature builds all manner of weird and wonderful materials.\n",

    "Historically, we made initial headway in the study of many-body systems, ignoring interactions and quantum properties. The ideal gas law and the Drude classical electron gas [@ashcroftSolidStatePhysics1976] are good examples. Including interactions into many-body physics leads to the Ising model [@isingBeitragZurTheorie1925], Landau theory [@landau2013fluid] and the classical theory of phase transitions [@jaegerEhrenfestClassificationPhase1998]. In contrast, condensed matter theory got it state in quantum many-body theory. Bloch's theorem [@blochÜberQuantenmechanikElektronen1929] predicted the properties of non-interacting electrons in crystal lattices, leading to band theory. In the same vein, advances were made in understanding the quantum origins of magnetism, including ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism [@MagnetismCondensedMatter].\n",

The properties of some materials cannot be understood without a taking into account all three effects and these are collectively called strongly correlated materials.

We'll start by looking at the latter but shall see that there are many links between three topics."

    "Mott Insulators are remarkable because their electrical insulator properties come from electron-electron interactions. Electrical conductivity, the bulk movement of electrons, requires both that there are electronic states very close in energy to the ground state and that those states are delocalised so that they can contribute to macroscopic transport. Band insulators are systems whose Fermi level falls within a gap in the density of states and thus fail the first criteria. Band insulators derive their character from the characteristics of the underlying lattice. Anderson Insulators have only localised electronic states near the fermi level and therefore fail the second criteria. We will discuss Anderson insulators and disorder in a later section.\n",

Any excitation must include states of double occupancy that cost energy $U$, hence the system has a finite bandgap and is an interaction driven Mott insulator. Depending on the lattice, the local moments may then order antiferromagnetically. Originally it was proposed that this antiferromagnetic order was the cause of the gap opening [@mottMetalInsulatorTransitions1990]. However, Mott insulators have been found [@law1TTaS2QuantumSpin2017; @ribakGaplessExcitationsGround2017] without magnetic order.
