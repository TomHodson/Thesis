Consider a flock of starlings like that of +@fig:Studland_Starlings. Watching the flock you'll see that it has a distinct outline, that waves of density will sometimes propagate through the closely packed birds and that the flock seems to respond to predators as a distinct object. The natural description of this phenomena is couched in terms of the flock rather than of the individual birds.\n",

The starlings are only interacting with their immediate six or seven neighbours\\ [@king2012murmurations; @balleriniInteractionRulingAnimal2008], what a physicist would call a _local interaction_. There is much philosophical debate about how exactly to define emergence\\ [@andersonMoreDifferent1972; @kivelsonDefiningEmergencePhysics2016] but for our purposes it enough to say that emergence is the fact that the aggregate behaviour of many interacting objects may necessitate a description very different from that of the individual objects. \n",

From these three ingredients nature builds all manner of weird and wonderful materials.\n",

In contrast, condensed matter theory got it state in quantum many-body theory. Bloch's theorem\\ [@bloch√úberQuantenmechanikElektronen1929] predicted the properties of non-interacting electrons in crystal lattices, leading to band theory.

Electrical conductivity, the bulk movement of electrons, requires both that there are electronic states very close in energy to the ground state and that those states are delocalised so that they can contribute to macroscopic transport. Band insulators are systems whose Fermi level falls within a gap in the density of states and thus fail the first criteria. Band insulators derive their character from the characteristics of the underlying lattice. Anderson Insulators have only localised electronic states near the fermi level and therefore fail the second criteria. We will discuss Anderson insulators and disorder in a later section.\n",
