A flock of starlings like that of @fig:Studland_Starlings is a good example. If you were to sit and watch a flock like this, you'd see that it has a distinct outline, that waves of density will sometimes propagate through the closely packed birds and that the flock seems to respond to predators as a distinct object.

There is much philosophical debate about how exactly to define emergence\\ [@andersonMoreDifferent1972; @kivelsonDefiningEmergencePhysics2016].

From these three ingredients, nature builds all manner of weird and wonderful materials.\n",

The ideal gas law and the Drude classical electron gas\\ [@ashcroftSolidStatePhysics1976] are good examples.

In contrast, condensed matter theory got its start in quantum many-body theory where the only electron-electron interaction considered is the Pauli exclusion principle. Bloch's theorem\\ [@bloch√úberQuantenmechanikElektronen1929], the core result of band theory, predicted the properties of non-interacting electrons in crystal lattices. It predicted, in particular, that band insulators arise when the electrons bands are filled, leaving the fermi level in a bandgap\\ [@ashcroftSolidStatePhysics1976]. In the same vein, advances were made in understanding the quantum origins of magnetism, including ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism\\ [@MagnetismCondensedMatter].\n",

This happens when the properties of the quasiparticles in the interacting system can be smoothly connected to the free fermions of the non-interacting system. \n",

Electrical conductivity, the bulk movement of electrons, requires both that there are electronic states very close in energy to the ground state and that those states are delocalised so that they can contribute to macroscopic transport. Band insulators are systems whose Fermi level falls within a gap in the density of states and thus fail the first criteria. Band insulators derive their character from the characteristics of the underlying lattice.

Our goal is to understand the Mott transition in more detail, the phase transition into a charge density wave state and how the localisation properties of the fermionic sector behave in one dimension. We were particularly interested to see if correlations in the disorder potential are enough to bring about localisation effects, such as mobility edges, that are normally only seen in higher dimensions.

    "Amorphous _magnetic_ systems have been investigated since the 1960s, mostly through the adaptation of theoretical tools developed for disordered systems\\ [@aharony1975critical; @Petrakovski1981; @kaneyoshi1992introduction; @Kaneyoshi2018] and with numerical methods\\ [@fahnle1984monte; @plascak2000ising]. Research on classical Heisenberg and Ising models accounts for the observed behaviour of ferromagnetism, disordered antiferromagnetism and widely observed spin glass behaviour\\ [@coey1978amorphous]. However, the role of spin-anisotropic interactions and quantum effects in amorphous magnets has not been addressed. \n",

    "In\\ [chapter 4](#chap:4-the-amorphous-kitaev-model), I will address the question of whether frustrated magnetic interactions on amorphous lattices can give rise to genuine quantum phases, i.e. to long-range entangled QSL\\ [@Anderson1973; @Knolle2019; @Savary2016; @Lacroix2011]. We will find that the answer is yes. I will introduce the amorphous Kitaev model, a generalisation of the KH model to random lattices with fixed coordination number three. I will show that this model is a solvable, amorphous, chiral spin liquid. As with the Yao-Kivelson model\\ [@yaoExactChiralSpin2007], the amorphous Kitaev model retains its exact solubility but the presence of plaquettes with an odd number of sides leads to a spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry. I will confirm prior observations that the form of the ground state is relatively simple\\ [@OBrienPRB2016; @eschmannThermodynamicClassificationThreedimensional2020] and unearth a rich phase diagram displaying Abelian as well as a non-Abelian chiral spin liquid phases. Furthermore, I will show that the system undergoes a finite-temperature phase transition to a thermal metal state and discuss possible experimental realisations. \n",

    "The next chapter,\\ [Chapter 2](#chap:2-background), will introduce some necessary background to the FK model, the KH model, and disorder and localisation."
