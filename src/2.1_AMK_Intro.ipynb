    "The Kitaev-Honeycomb model is remarkable because it was the first such model that combined three key properties.\n",

    "First, it is a plausible tight binding Hamiltonian. The form of the Hamiltonian could be realised by a real material. Indeed candidate materials such as $\\alpha\\mathrm{-RuCl}_3$ were quickly found [@banerjeeProximateKitaevQuantum2016; @trebstKitaevMaterials2022] that are expected to behave according to the Kitaev with small corrections. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the Kitaev Honeycomb model is deeply interesting to modern condensed matter theory. Its ground state is almost the canonical example of the long sought after quantum spin liquid state. Its excitations are anyons, particles that can only exist in two dimensions that break the normal fermion/boson dichotomy. Anyons have been the subject of much attention because, among other reasons, there are proposals to braid them through space and time to achieve noise tolerant quantum computations @freedmanTopologicalQuantumComputation2003.

Here I will look at the gauge symmetries of the model as well as its solution via a transformation to a Majorana hamiltonian. From this discusssion we will see that for the the model to be sovleable it need only be defined on a trivalent, tri-edge-colourable lattice [@Nussinov2009]. \n",

I'll make an assessment of the gapless, abelian and non-abelian phases that are present as well as spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and topological edge states. We will also compare the zero temperature phase diagram to that of the Kitaev Honeycomb Model. Next I will take the model to finite temperature and demonstrate that there is a phase transition to a thermal metal state.\n",

    "However in the non-Abelian phase we have to wrangle with monodromy [@chungExplicitMonodromyMoore2007; @oshikawaTopologicalDegeneracyNonAbelian2007]. Monodromy is behaviour of objects as they move around a singularity. This manifests here in that the identity of a vortex and cloud of Majoranas can change as we wind them around the torus in such a way that rather than anhilating to the vacuum the anhilate to create an excited state instead of a ground state. This means we end up with only three degenerate ground states in the non-Abelian phase $(+1, +1), (+1, -1), (-1, +1)$ [@chungTopologicalQuantumPhase2010, yaoAlgebraicSpinLiquid2009a]. The way that this shows up concretly is that the projector enforces both flux and fermion parity. When we wind a vortex around both non-contractible loops of the torus, it flips the flux parity which forces means we have to introduce a fermionic excitation to make the state physical. Hence the process does not give a fourth ground state."

    "(Bond Sector) A state in the bond sector is specified by assigning $\\pm 1$ to each edge of the lattice. However this description has a substantial gauge degeneracy. We can simplfy things by decomposing each state into the product of three kinds of objects: (Vortex Sector) Only a small number of bonds need to be flipped (compared to some arbitrary reference) to reconstruct the vortex sector. The edges here are chosen from a spanning tree of the dual lattice, so there are no loops. (Gauge Field) The 'loopiness' of the bond sector can be factored out giving a network of loops that can always be written as a product the of the gauge operators $D_j$. (Topolical Sector) Finally there are two loops that have no effect on the vortex sector, nor can they be constructed from gauge symmetries. These can be thought of as two fluxes $\\Phi_{x/y}$ that thread through the major and minor axes of the torus. Measuring $\\Phi_{x/y}$ corresponds to constructing Wilson loops around the axes of the torus. We can flip the value of $\\Phi_{x}$ by transporting a vortex pair around the torus in the $y$  direction and that is what is shown here. In each of the three figures on the right, black bonds correspond to those that must be flipped, composing the three together gives back the original bond sector on the left.\n",
