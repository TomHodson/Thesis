    "Within a flux sector, the fermion gap $\\Delta_f$ measures the energy between the fermionic ground state and the first excited state. This graph shows the fermion gap as a function of system size for the ground state flux sector and for a configuration of random fluxes. We see that the disorder induced by an putting the Kitaev model on an amorphous lattice does not close the gap in the ground state. The gap closes in the flux disordered limit is good evidence that the system transitions to a gapless thermal metal state at high temperature. Each point shows an average over 100 lattice realisations. System size $L$ is defined $\\sqrt{N}$ where N is the number of plaquettes in the system.

    "Amorphous materials are glassy condensed matter systems characterised by short-range constraints in the absence of long-range crystalline order as first studied in amorphous semiconductors~\\cite{Yonezawa1983,zallen2008physics}. In general, the bonds of a whole range of covalent compounds enforce local constraints around each ion, e.g.~a fixed coordination number $z$, which has enabled the prediction of energy gaps even in lattices without translational symmetry~\\cite{Weaire1976,gaskell1979structure}, the most famous example being amorphous Ge and Si with $z=4$~\\cite{Weaire1971,betteridge1973possible}. Recently, following the discovery of topological insulators (TIs) it has been shown that similar phases can exist in amorphous systems characterized by protected edge states and topological bulk invariants~\\cite{mitchellAmorphousTopologicalInsulators2018,agarwala2019topological,marsalTopologicalWeaireThorpeModels2020,costa2019toward,agarwala2020higher,spring2021amorphous,corbae2019evidence}. However, research on electronic systems has been mostly focused on non-interacting systems with a few notable exceptions for understanding the occurrence of superconductivity~\\cite{buckel1954einfluss,mcmillan1981electron,bergmann1976amorphous} {\\bf JK: CECK OLD EMAIL WITH THEORY WORKS} in amorphous materials and recently the effect of strong repulsion in amorphous TIs~\\cite{kim2022fractionalization}.         \n",

    "Magnetic phases in amorphous systems have been investigated since the 1960s, mostly through the adaptation of theoretical tools developed for disordered systems \\cite{aharony1975critical,Petrakovski1981,kaneyoshi1992introduction,Kaneyoshi2018} and numerical methods~\\cite{fahnle1984monte,plascak2000ising}. Research focused on classical Heisenberg and Ising models which have been shown to account for observed behavior of ferromagnetism, disordered antiferromagnetism and widely observed spin glass behaviour~\\cite{coey1978amorphous}. However, the role of spin-anisotropic interactions and quantum effects has not been addressed. Similarly, it is an open question whether magnetic frustration in amorphous quantum magnets can give rise to long-range entangled quantum spin liquid (QSL) phases. \n",

    "%Broad constraints to the possible phases hosted by Heisenberg amorphous magnets were provided by the phenomenological theory developed by Andreev and Marchenko \\cite{Andreev1,Andreev2,Andreev3}. The phases in this theory are described by a set of macroscopic magnetic vectors that transform according to the irreducible representations of the group of spatial symmetries of the system \\cite{Andreev1}. Amorphous magnets are treated, on average, as homogeneous and isotropic, being thus symmetric under three-dimensional rotations and spatial inversion \\cite{Andreev2}. Only three types of phases are consistent to this group of symmetries, corresponding to ferromagnets, disordered antiferromagnets, or spin glasses \\cite{Andreev2,Andreev3}.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\par\n",
    "Two intentional simplifications of Andreev's and Marchenko's theory were the neglect of spin-orbit coupling induced anisotropies and the effects arising from the local structure of amorphous lattices. It is then expected that their theory is invalid for amorphous compounds generated from crystalline magnets with strong spin-orbit coupling with tight geometrical arrangements. Several instances of these magnets were synthesized in the last decade, among which we highlight the Kitaev materials \\cite{Jackeli2009,HerrmannsAnRev2018,Winter2017,TrebstPhysRep2022,Takagi2019}. It was suggested (and later observed) that heavy-ion Mott insulators formed by edge-sharing octahedra could be good platforms for the celebrated Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice \\cite{Jackeli2009}, an exactly solvable model whose ground state is a quantum spin liquid (QSL)~\\cite{Anderson1973,Knolle2019,Savary2016,Lacroix2011} characterized by a static $\\mathbb Z_2$ gauge field and Majorana fermion excitations \\cite{kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006}. The model displays bond-dependent Ising-like exchanges that give rise to local symmetries, which are essential to its mapping onto a free fermion problem \\cite{Baskaran2007,Baskaran2008}. Such a mapping is rigorously extendable to any three-coordinated graph in two or three dimensions satisfying a simple geometrical condition \\cite{Nussinov2009,OBrienPRB2016, yaoExactChiralSpin2007,Peri2020}. Thus, it reasonable to suppose that the Kitaev model is also analytically treatable on certain amorphous lattices, therefore becoming a realistic starting point to study the overlooked possibility of QSLs in amorphous magnets. \\par\n",
    "In this letter, we study Kitaev spin liquids (KSLs) stabilized by the $S=1/2$ Kitaev model \\cite{kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006} on coordination number $z=3$ random networks generated via Voronoi tessellation \\cite{mitchellAmorphousTopologicalInsulators2018,marsalTopologicalWeaireThorpeModels2020}. On these lattices, the KSLs generically break time-reversal symmetry (TRS), as expected for any Majorana QSL in graphs containing odd-sided plaquettes \\cite{Chua2011,ChuaPRB2011,Fiete2012,Natori2016,Wu2009, WangHaoranPRB2021}. An extensive numerical study showed that the $\\mathbb Z_2$ gauge fluxes on the ground state can be described by a conjecture consistent with Lieb's theorem \\cite{lieb_flux_1994}. In contrast to the honeycomb case, the amorphous KSLs are gapless only along certain critical lines. These manifolds separate two gapped KSLs that are topologically differentiated by a local Chern number $\\nu$ \\cite{peru_preprint, mitchellAmorphousTopologicalInsulators2018} in analogy with the KSLs on the decorated honeycomb lattice \\cite{yaoExactChiralSpin2007}. The $\\nu=0$ phase is the amorphous analogue of the abelian toric-code QSL \\cite{kitaev_fault-tolerant_2003}, whereas the $\\nu=\\pm1$ KSLs is a non-Abelian chiral spin liquid (CSL). We study two specific features of the latter liquid: topologically protected edge states and a thermal-induced Anderson transition to a thermal metal phase \\cite{selfThermallyInducedMetallic2019}. \\par\n",

    "% The Kitaev spin liquids are classified by their Majorana fermion dispersion and topological properties. On the honeycomb lattice, tuning the exchange couplings $J^\\alpha$ can change the ground state from a gapped QSL with Abelian anyonic excitations (e.g., when $J^z\\gg J^x,J^y$) or gapless (e.g., when $J^z=J^x=J^y$). In the latter case, breaking time reversal symmetry (TRS) opens a gap that signals the onset of a chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase supporting non-Abelian excitations and protected edge modes. On the honeycomb lattice, CSLs are only obtained by perturbing a Hamiltonian with, for example, magnetic fields \\cite{kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006} or Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchanges \\cite{Ralko2020}. CSLs on the pure Kitaev model can be obtained on $z=3$ lattices containing odd-sided plaquettes, for which any Majorana QSL displays spontaneous TRS breaking \\cite{Chua2011,ChuaPRB2011,Fiete2012,Natori2016,Wu2009, WangHaoranPRB2021}, as confirmed on decorated honeycomb \\cite{yaoExactChiralSpin2007} and non-Archimedean \\cite{Peri2020} lattices.\n",

For each plaquette of the lattice, we can define the conserved operator $ W_p = \\prod \\sigma_j^{\\alpha}\\sigma_k^{\\alpha}$, where the product runs clockwise over the bonds around the plaquette. This provides an extensive number of conserved plaquettes that allow us to split the Hilbert space in terms of the eigenvalues of $W_p$.\\par\n",
    "The KSL is uncovered by transforming eqn.~\\ref{eqn:kitham} to a four-Majorana representation of the spin operators, $\\sigma_i^\\alpha = i b_i^\\alpha c_i$ \\cite{kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006}, where the Hamiltonian takes the form\n",

Once the $\\hat u_{jk}$ eigenvalues are fixed, the Kitaev model becomes equivalent to a fermionic problem that can be diagonalized with standard methods \\cite{BlaizotRipka1986}. \\par\n",
    "The Kitaev Hamiltonian remains exactly solvable on any graph in which no site connects to more than one bond of the same type \\cite{Nussinov2009}. Thus, we are  restricted to lattices in which every vertex has coordination number $z \\leq 3$. Here, such graphs are generated with Voronoi tessellation \\cite{florescu_designer_2009}. A set of points are sampled uniformly from the unit square and cells are generated as the region of space closer to a given point than any other. The lattice is given by the boundaries between cells with edges at the interface of two cells and vertices at the point where three edges meet. Periodic boundary conditions are imposed by tiling the initial set of points and then connecting corresponding edges that cross the unit square boundaries - see \\cref{apx:lattice_construction} for technical details. One example of such an amorphous lattice is shown in~\\cref{fig:example_lattice}(a).\\par\n",
    "Once a random network has been generated, the bonds types must be assigned in a way that is consistent with our condition, which we refer to as a \\textit{three-edge colouring}. The problem of finding such a colouring was shown to be equivalent to the classical problem of four-colouring the faces, which is always solvable in planar graphs~\\cite{Tait1880, appelEveryPlanarMap1989a}. On the torus, a face colouring can require up to seven colours \\cite{ringel_solution_1968}, and so not all graphs can be assumed to be 3-edge colourable. However, such exceptions are rare -- every graph generated in this study admitted multiple distinct 3-edge colourings. The problem of finding a colouring for a given graph can be reduced to a Boolean satisfiability problem \\cite{Karp1972}, which we then solve using the open-source solver \\texttt{MiniSAT}~\\cite{imms-sat18}. \\par\n",
    "Once the three-edge colouring has been found, the Kitaev Hamiltonian is mapped onto eqn.~\\ref{eqn:majorana_hamiltonian}, which corresponds to the spin fractionalization in terms of a static $\\mathbb Z_2$ gauge fields and $c$ matter as indicated in ~\\cref{fig:example_lattice}(b) \\cite{Baskaran2007}.  Strictly speaking, the Majorana system is equivalent to the original spin system after applying a projector operator \\cite{pedrocchiPhysicalSolutionsKitaev2011,Zschocke_Physical_states2015,selfThermallyInducedMetallic2019}, whose form is presented in \\cref{apx:projector}. Despite this caveat, one can still use eqn.~\\ref{eqn:majorana_hamiltonian} to evaluate the expectation values of operators conserving $\\hat u_{jk}$ in the thermodynamic limit \\cite{Yao2009,knolle_dynamics_2016}. This type of operator is exemplified by the Hamiltonian itself, for which the ground state energy of a fixed sector is the sum of the negative eigenvalues of $iA/4$ in eqn.~\\ref{eqn:majorana_hamiltonian}, and whose excitations are extracted from the positive eigenvalues of the same matrix. \n",

    "{\\it Fluxes and the Ground State --- } \n",
    "Let us now consider the conserved operators $ W_p = \\prod \\sigma_j^{\\alpha}\\sigma_k^{\\alpha}$ on amorphous lattices. When represented in the Majorana Hilbert space, these operators correspond to ordered products of $\\hat u_{jk}$, and their fixed eigenvalues are written as\n",

In periodic boundaries there is an additional  pair of global $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes $\\Phi_x$ and $\\Phi_y$, which are calculated along an arbitrary closed path that wraps the torus in the $x$ and $y$ directions respectively. The energy difference between distinct flux sectors decays exponentially with system size, so that the ground state of any flux sector in the thermodynamic limit displays a fourfold topological degeneracy \\cite{kitaev_fault-tolerant_2003}. \\par\n",
    "We now need to determine the ground state flux sectors. First, let us recall that Majorana QSLs emerging on graphs containing odd-sided plaquette undergo a spontaneous TRS breaking \\cite{Chua2011,yaoExactChiralSpin2007,ChuaPRB2011,Fiete2012,Natori2016,Wu2009,Peri2020, WangHaoranPRB2021}. Therefore, there will be always a twofold ground state degeneracy due to time-reversal, in which one ground state is related to the other by inversion of imaginary $\\phi_p$ fluxes \\cite{yaoExactChiralSpin2007}. An insight pointing to the ground state sectors come from the model on the honeycomb lattice, for which a theorem proved by Lieb sets that the ground state sector to be $\\phi_p=+1$, $\\forall p$ \\cite{lieb_flux_1994}. Although Lieb's theorem is not extendable to amorphous lattices, it is suggested the ground state energy for a sufficiently large system is minimised by setting \\cite{OBrienPRB2016}\n",

    "where $n_{\\textup{sides}}$ is the number of edges that form $p$ and the global choice of the sign of $i$ gives each of the two TRS-degenerate ground state flux sectors. Such a conjecture is consistent with Lieb's theorem on regular lattices \\cite{lieb_flux_1994} and is supported by numerical evidence as detailed in \\cref{apx:ground_state}. Once we have identified the ground state, any other sector can be characterized by the configuration of vortices, i.e. by the plaquettes whose flux is flipped with respect to $\\left\\{\\phi_p^{\\textup{g.s.}}\\right\\}$.\\par\n",

The presence of odd-sided plaquettes on these lattices let to a spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry, leading to the emergence of a chiral spin liquid phase. Furthermore we found evidence that the amorphous system undergoes an Anderson transition to a thermal metal phase, driven by the proliferation of vortices with increasing temperature. The next step is to search for an experimental realisation in amorphous Kitaev materials, which can be created from crystalline ones using several methods \\cite{Weaire1976,Petrakovski1981,Kaneyoshi2018}. \\par\n",

This was done by generating a large number ($\\sim$ 25,000) of lattices and exhaustively checking every possible flux sector to find the configuration with the lowest energy.

Note that the $-1$ appears in this counting because fluxes can only be flipped in pairs. To be able to search over the entire flux space, one is necessarily restricted to looking at small system sizes -- we were able to check all flux sectors for systems with $n_p \\leq 16$ in a reasonable amount of time. However, at such small system size we find that finite size effects are substantial enough to destroy our results. In order to overcome these effects we tile the system and use Bloch's theorem (a trick that we shall refer to as \\textit{twist-averaging} for reasons that shall become clear) to efficiently find the energy of a much larger (but periodic) lattice. Thus we are able to suppress finite size effects, at the expense of losing long-range disorder in the lattice.\\par\n",

In this case we include not only plaquettes, but circuits that encircle several plaquettes. In periodic boundaries we must also consider \n",

    "% In the language of graph theory, this matrix may be interpreted as representing a weighted, directed digraph, with weights determined by the individual entries of $M$. The Harary-Sachs theorem \\cite{StreifelSkewCharacteristic2016,HararyDeterminant1962} states that the characteristic polynomial of such a matrix may be written in terms of the weights of the cycles of the graph, defined as the product of the elements of $M$ around some closed path $\\mathcal C$ on the lattice,\n",
    "% \\begin{align}\n",
    "%     w_{\\mathcal{C}} = \\prod_{\\mathcal {C}} M_{jk}.\n",
    "% \\end{align}\n",
    "% These weights are similar to the fluxes defined in the bulk text, with two important differences. Firstly, the cyclic weights include the factor of $J^\\alpha$ in the product. Secondly, unlike tthe fluxes, which are defined for individual plaquettes, the weights are  calculated for every closed path on the lattice. The takeaway is that the characteristic polynomial, and thus all eigenvalues, is determined only by the values of these weights. Any change to the set of $u_{jk}$ that does not affect the weight of any cycles will have no effect on the energies of the system. For example a gauge transformation, where $u_{jk}$ is flipped on the three edges connected to a chosen site, cannot affect the energies, as every cycle passing through the chosen site must contain two of the flipped edges. \\par\n",
