    "\n",
    "First we fully eumerate the flux sectors of ~25,000 periodic systems with a disordered unit cell of up to 16 plaquettes ($2^{16-1}$ sectors). Going to larger system sizes in impractical because of the exponential sclaling. However, as discussed earlier, finite size effects play a large role for small systems [@kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006]. To get around this we look at periodic systems with amorphous unit cells. This reduces the finite size effects but we can use Bloch's theorem to diagonalise periodic systems with only a linear penalty in system area. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at periodic systems comes at the expense of removing longer-range disorder from our lattices so we bolster this by comparing the behaviour of periodic lattice with amorphous to unit cells to fully amorphous lattice as we scale the size of the unit cell. We show that the energetic effect of introducing perodicity scales away as we go to larger system sizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "From these two observations we argue that the results for small periodic systems generalise to large amorphous systems. We perform this analysis for both the isotropic point ($J^\\alpha = 1$), as well as in the toric code phase ($J^x = J^y = 0.25, J^z = 1$)."

    "\n",
    "We have studied an extension of the Kitaev honeycomb model to amorphous lattices with coordination number $z= 3$. We found that it is able to support two quantum spin liquid phases that can be distinguished using a real-space generalisation of the Chern number. The presence of odd-sided plaquettes on these lattices let to a spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry, leading to the emergence of a chiral spin liquid phase. Furthermore we found evidence that the amorphous system undergoes an Anderson transition to a thermal metal phase, driven by the proliferation of vortices with increasing temperature. \n",

    "\n",
    "We did find a small number of lattices for the ground state conjecture did not correctly predict the true ground state flux sector. I see two possibilities for what could cause this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly it could be a a finite size effect that is somehow amplfied by certain rare lattice configurations. It would be interesting to try to elucidate what lattice features are present when the ground state conjecture fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, it might be telling that the ground state conjecture failed in the toric code phase where the couplings are anisotropic. Clearly the colouring does not matter much in the isotropic phase. However an avenue that I did not explore was whether the particular choice of colouring for a lattice affects the physical properties in the toris code phase. It is possible that some property of the particular colouring chosen is what leads to failure of the ground state conjecture here.\n",

    "Following the evidence for an induced chiral spin liquid phase in crystalline Kitaev materials [@Kasahara2018; @Yokoi2021; @Yamashita2020; @Bruin2022], it would be interesting to investigate if a similar state is produced on its amorphous counterpart. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probably one way to make this theory experimentally relevant is to do experiments on amorphous phases of Kitaev materials. These phases can be obtained by liquifying the material and cooling it fast. Apparently, most of crystalline magnets can be transformed into amorphous ones through this process.\n",

    "Besides the usual half-quantized signature on thermal Hall effect [@Kasahara2018; @Yokoi2021; @Yamashita2020; @Bruin2022], such a CSL could be also characterized using local probes such as spin-polarized scanning-tunneling microscopy [@Feldmeier2020; @Konig2020; @Udagawa2021].
