    "We have studied an extension of the Kitaev honeycomb model to amorphous lattices with coordination number $z= 3$. We found that it is able to support two quantum spin liquid phases that can be distinguished using a real-space generalisation of the Chern number. The presence of odd-sided plaquettes on these lattices let to a spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry, leading to the emergence of a chiral spin liquid phase. Furthermore we found evidence that the amorphous system undergoes an Anderson transition to a thermal metal phase, driven by the proliferation of vortices with increasing temperature. \n",

    "We did find a small number of lattices for the ground state conjecture did not correctly predict the true ground state flux sector. I see two possibilities for what could cause this.\n",

    "Firstly it could be a a finite size effect that is somehow amplfied by certain rare lattice configurations. It would be interesting to try to elucidate what lattice features are present when the ground state conjecture fails.\n",

    "Alternatively, it might be telling that the ground state conjecture failed in the toric code phase where the couplings are anisotropic. Clearly the colouring does not matter much in the isotropic phase. However an avenue that I did not explore was whether the particular choice of colouring for a lattice affects the physical properties in the toris code phase. It is possible that some property of the particular colouring chosen is what leads to failure of the ground state conjecture here.\n",

    "Besides the usual half-quantized signature on thermal Hall effect [@Kasahara2018; @Yokoi2021; @Yamashita2020; @Bruin2022], such a CSL could be also characterized using local probes such as spin-polarized scanning-tunneling microscopy [@Feldmeier2020; @Konig2020; @Udagawa2021]. The same probes would also be useful to manipulate non-Abelian anyons [@Pereira2020], thereby implementing elementary operations for topological quantum computation. Finally, the thermal metal phase can be diagnosed using bulk heat transport measurements [@Beenakker2013].\n",
