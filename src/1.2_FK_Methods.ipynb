    "The choice of the transition function for MCMC is under-determined as one only needs to satisfy a set of balance conditions for which there are many solutions [@kellyReversibilityStochasticNetworks1981]. Here, we incorporate a modification to the standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm [@hastingsMonteCarloSampling1970] gleaned from Krauth [@krauthIntroductionMonteCarlo1998]. Let us first recall the standard algorithm which decomposes the transition probability into $\\T(a \\to b) = \\p(a \\to b)\\A(a \\to b)$. Here, $\\p$ is the proposal distribution that we can directly sample from while $\\A$ is the acceptance probability. The standard Metropolis-Hastings choice is $$\\A(a \\to b) = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{\\p(b\\to a)}{\\p(a\\to b)} e^{-\\beta \\Delta E}\\right)\\;,$$ with $\\Delta E = E_b - E_a$. The walk then proceeds by sampling a state $b$ from $\\p$ and moving to $b$ with probability $\\A(a \\to b)$. The latter operation is typically implemented by performing a transition if a uniform random sample from the unit interval is less than $\\A(a \\to b)$ and otherwise repeating the current state as the next step in the random walk. The proposal distribution is often symmetric so does not appear in $\\A$. Here, we flip a small number of sites in $b$ at random to generate proposals, which is indeed symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our computations [@hodsonMCMCFKModel2021] we employ a modification of the algorithm which is based on the observation that the free energy of the FK system is composed of a classical part which is much quicker to compute than the quantum part. Hence, we can obtain a computational speedup by first considering the value of the classical energy difference $\\Delta H_s$ and rejecting the transition if the former is too high. We only compute the quantum energy difference $\\Delta F_c$ if the transition is accepted. We then perform a second rejection sampling step based upon it. This corresponds to two nested comparisons with the majority of the work only occurring if the first test passes and has the acceptance function $$\\A(a \\to b) = \\min\\left(1, e^{-\\beta \\Delta H_s}\\right)\\min\\left(1, e^{-\\beta \\Delta F_c}\\right)\\;.$$\n",

    "For the model parameters used in Fig. [2](#fig:indiv_IPR){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:indiv_IPR\"}, we find that with our new scheme the matrix diagonalisation is skipped around 30% of the time at $T = 2.5$ and up to 80% at $T = 1.5$. We observe that for $N = 50$, the matrix diagonalisation, if it occurs, occupies around 60% of the total computation time for a single step. This rises to 90% at N = 300 and further increases for larger N. We therefore get the greatest speedup for large system sizes at low temperature where many prospective transitions are rejected at the classical stage and the matrix computation takes up the greatest fraction of the total computation time. The upshot is that we find a speedup of up to a factor of 10 at the cost of very little extra algorithmic complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our two-step method should be distinguished from the more common method for speeding up MCMC which is to add asymmetry to the proposal distribution to make it as similar as possible to $\\min\\left(1, e^{-\\beta \\Delta E}\\right)$. This reduces the number of rejected states, which brings the algorithm closer in efficiency to a direct sampling method. However it comes at the expense of requiring a way to directly sample from this complex distribution, a problem which MCMC was employed to solve in the first place. For example, recent work trains restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) to generate samples for the proposal distribution of the FK model [@huangAcceleratedMonteCarlo2017]. The RBMs are chosen as a parametrisation of the proposal distribution that can be efficiently sampled from while offering sufficient flexibility that they can be adjusted to match the target distribution. Our proposed method is considerably simpler and does not require training while still reaping some of the benefits of reduced computation."

Since $e^{-\\beta F(x)}$ is relatively easy to evaluate, MCMC provides a useful method for finite temperature physics. \n",

Ideal values for the acceptance rate can be calculated under certain assumptions [@robertsWeakConvergenceOptimal1997].

Indeed even if we could do it, it would still be computationally wasteful since at low temperatures the sums are dominated by low energy excitations about the ground states of the system. Even worse, in our case we must fully solve the fermionic system via exact diagonalisation for each classical state in the sum, a very expensive operation!~\\footnote{The effort involved in exact diagonalisation scales like $N^2$ for systems with a tri-diagonal matrix representation (open boundary conditions and nearest neighbour hopping) and like $N^3$ for a generic matrix [@bolchQueueingNetworksMarkov2006; @usmaniInversionTridiagonalJacobi1994].\n",

However a key insight is that after the convergence time, every state generated  is a sample from $P(\\s; \\beta)$! They are not, however, independent samples. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:raw} it is already clear that the samples of the order parameter m have some auto-correlation because only a few spins are flipped each step but even when the number of spins flipped per step is increased, Fig.~\\ref{fig:m_autocorr} shows that it can be an important effect near the phase transition. Let's define the auto-correlation time $\\tau(O)$ informally as the number of MCMC samples of some observable O that are statistically equal to one independent sample or equivalently as the number of MCMC steps after which the samples are correlated below some cutoff, see [@krauthIntroductionMonteCarlo1996] for a more rigorous definition involving a sum over the auto-correlation function.

There are many methods in the literature for estimating the true variance of $\\qex{O}$ and deciding how many steps are needed but my approach has been to run a small number of parallel chains, which are independent, in order to estimate the statistical error produced. This is a slightly less computationally efficient because it requires throwing away those $k$ steps generated before convergence multiple times but it is a conceptually simple workaround.\n",
