    "The FK model is one of the simplest models of the correlated electron problem. It captures the essence of the interaction between itinerant and localized electrons, equivalent to a model of hopping fermions coupled to a classical Ising field. It was originally introduced to explain the metal-insulator transition in f-electron systems but in its long history it has been interpreted variously as a model of electrons and ions, binary alloys or of crystal formation [@hubbardj.ElectronCorrelationsNarrow1963; @falicovSimpleModelSemiconductorMetal1969; @gruberFalicovKimballModelReview1996; @gruberFalicovKimballModel2006]. Despite its simplicity, the FK model has a rich phase diagram in $D \\geq 2$ dimensions. For example, it shows an interaction-induced gap opening even at high temperatures, similar to the corresponding Hubbard Model [@brandtThermodynamicsCorrelationFunctions1989]. In 1D, the ground state phenomenology as a function of filling can be rich [@gruberGroundStatesSpinless1990] but the system is disordered for all $T > 0$ [@kennedyItinerantElectronModel1986]. Moreover, the model has been a test-bed for many-body methods, interest took off when an exact DMFT solution in the infinite dimensional case was found [@antipovCriticalExponentsStrongly2014; @ribicNonlocalCorrelationsSpectral2016; @freericksExactDynamicalMeanfield2003; @herrmannNonequilibriumDynamicalCluster2016].\n",

    "The presence of the classical field makes the model amenable to an exact numerical treatment at finite temperature via a sign problem free MCMC algorithm [@devriesGapsDensitiesStates1993; @devriesSimplifiedHubbardModel1993; @antipovInteractionTunedAndersonMott2016; @debskiPossibilityDetectionFinite2016; @herrmannSpreadingCorrelationsFalicovKimball2018; @maskaThermodynamicsTwodimensionalFalicovKimball2006]. The MCMC treatment motivates a view of the classical background field as a disorder potential, which suggests an intimate link to localisation physics. Indeed, thermal fluctuations of the classical sector act as disorder potentials drawn from a thermal distribution and the emergence of disorder in a translationally invariant Hamiltonian links the FK model to recent interest in disorder-free localisation [@smithDisorderFreeLocalization2017; @smithDynamicalLocalizationMathbbZ2018; @brenesManyBodyLocalizationDynamics2018].\n",

    "Dimensionality is crucial for the physics of both localisation and FTPTs. In 1D, disorder generally dominates, even the weakest disorder exponentially localises *all* single particle eigenstates. Only longer-range correlations of the disorder potential can potentially induce delocalization [@aubryAnalyticityBreakingAnderson1980; @dassarmaLocalizationMobilityEdges1990; @dunlapAbsenceLocalizationRandomdimer1990]. Thermodynamically, short-range interactions cannot overcome thermal defects in 1D which prevents ordered phases at nonzero temperature [@andersonAbsenceDiffusionCertain1958; @goldshteinPurePointSpectrum1977; @abrahamsScalingTheoryLocalization1979; @kramerLocalizationTheoryExperiment1993]. However, the absence of an FTPT in the short ranged FK chain is far from obvious because the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction mediated by the fermions [@kasuyaTheoryMetallicFerro1956; @rudermanIndirectExchangeCoupling1954; @vanvleckNoteInteractionsSpins1962; @yosidaMagneticPropertiesCuMn1957] decays as $r^{-1}$ in 1D [@rusinCalculationRKKYRange2017a]. This could in principle induce the necessary long-range interactions for the classical Ising background [@thoulessLongRangeOrderOneDimensional1969; @peierlsIsingModelFerromagnetism1936]. However, Kennedy and Lieb established rigorously that at half-filling a CDW phase only exists at $T = 0$ for the 1D FK model [@kennedyItinerantElectronModel1986].\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we construct a generalised one-dimensional FK model with long-range interactions which induces the otherwise forbidden CDW phase at non-zero temperature. We find a rich phase diagram with a CDW FTPT and interaction-tuned Anderson versus Mott localized phases similar to the 2D FK model [@antipovInteractionTunedAndersonMott2016]. We explore the localization properties of the fermionic sector and find that the localisation lengths vary dramatically across the phases and for different energies. Although moderate system sizes indicate the coexistence of localized and delocalized states within the CDW phase, we find quantitatively similar behaviour in a model of uncorrelated binary disorder on a CDW background. For large system sizes, i.e. for our 1D disorder model we can treat linear sizes of several thousand sites, we find that all states are eventually localized with a localization length which diverges towards zero temperature.\n",

To study the CDW phase at finite temperature in 1D, we add an additional coupling that is both long-ranged and staggered by a factor $(-1)^{|i-j|}$.

    "Taking the limit $U = 0$ decouples the spins from the fermions, which gives a spin sector governed by a classical LRI model. Note, the transformation of the spins $S_i \\to (-1)^{i} S_i$ maps the AFM model to the FM one. We recall that Peierls' classic argument can be extended to show that, for the 1D LRI model, a power law decay of $\\alpha < 2$ is required for a FTPT as the energy of defect domain then scales with the system size and can overcome the entropic contribution.
