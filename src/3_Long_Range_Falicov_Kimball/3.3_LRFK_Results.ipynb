    "Looking at the results of our MCMC simulations, we find a rich phase diagram with a CDW FTPT and interaction-tuned Anderson versus Mott localised phases similar to the 2D FK model\\ [@antipovInteractionTunedAndersonMott2016]. We explore the localisation properties of the fermionic sector and find that the localisation lengths vary dramatically across the phases and for different energies. Although moderate system sizes indicate the coexistence of localised and delocalised states within the CDW phase, we find quantitatively similar behaviour in a model of uncorrelated binary disorder on a CDW background. For large system sizes, i.e. for our 1D disorder model we can treat linear sizes of several thousand sites, we find that all states are eventually localised with a localisation length which diverges towards zero temperature.\n",

This demonstrates that the phase transition is driven by the long-range term $J$ with little effect from the coupling to the fermions $U$. The physics of the spin sector in the LRFK model mimics that of the LRI model and is not significantly altered by the presence of the fermions. In 2D the transition to the CDW phase is mediated by an RKYY-like interaction\\ [@rusinCalculationRKKYRange2017] but this is insufficient to stabilise long-range order in 1D. That the critical temperature $T_c$ does not depend on $U$ in our model further confirms this.\n",

However, my main interest concerns the additional structure of the fermionic sector in the high temperature phase. Following Ref.\\ [@antipovInteractionTunedAndersonMott2016], we can distinguish between the Mott and Anderson insulating phases. The Mott insulator is characterised by a gapped DOS in the absence of a CDW, instead the gap is driven entirely by interaction effect. Thus, the opening of a gap for large $U$ is distinct from the gap-opening induced by the translational symmetry breaking in the CDW state below $T_c$. The Anderson phase is gapless but, as we explain below, shows localised fermionic eigenstates hence it also has insulating character."

An additional complication arises from the fact that the scaling exponent may display intermediate behaviours for correlated disorder and in the vicinity of a localisation-delocalisation transition\\ [@kramerLocalizationTheoryExperiment1993; @eversAndersonTransitions2008].

    "The FK model is one of the simplest non-trivial models of interacting fermions. We studied its thermodynamic and localisation properties brought down in dimensionality to 1D by adding a novel long-ranged coupling designed to stabilise the CDW phase present in dimension two and above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our MCMC approach emphasises the presence of a disorder-free localisation mechanism within the translationally invariant system. Further, it gives a significant speed up over the naive method. We show that the LRFK model retains much of the rich phase diagram of its higher dimensional cousins. Careful scaling analysis indicates that all the single particle eigenstates eventually localise at non-zero temperature albeit only for very large system sizes of several thousand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work raises a number of interesting questions for future research. A straightforward but numerically challenging problem is to pin down the model's behaviour closer to the critical point where correlations in the spin sector would become significant.  Would this modify the localisation behaviour? It has been shown that Anderson models with long-range correlated disorder potentials can have complex localisation behaviour not normally seen in 1D\\ [@aubryAnalyticityBreakingAnderson1980; @shimasakiAnomalousLocalizationMultifractality2022]. MCMC methods with local spin updates tend to experience critical slowing down near classical critical points\\ [@geyerPracticalMarkovChain1992; @levinMarkovChainsMixing2017; @vatsMultivariateOutputAnalysis2015]. Cluster updates methods can help to alleviate this but it is not clear if they can be adapted to incorporate the energetic contributions from the fermion sector\\ [@evertzClusterAlgorithmVertex1993; @fukuiOrderNClusterMonte2009; @wolffCollectiveMonteCarlo1989].\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to other solvable models of disorder-free localisation, we expect intriguing out-of equilibrium physics, for example slow entanglement dynamics akin to more generic interacting systems\\ [@hartLogarithmicEntanglementGrowth2020]. One could also investigate whether the rich ground state phenomenology of the FK model as a function of filling\\ [@gruberGroundStatesSpinless1990] such as the devil's staircase\\ [@michelettiCompleteDevilTextquotesingles1997] as well as superconductor like states\\ [@caiVisualizingEvolutionMott2016] could be stabilised at finite temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a broader context, we envisage that long-range interactions can also be used to gain a deeper understanding of the temperature evolution of topological phases. One example would be a LRFK version of the celebrated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model where one could explore the interplay of topological bound states and thermal domain wall defects. Finally, the rich physics of our model should be realisable in systems with long-range interactions, such as trapped ion quantum simulators, where one can also explore the fully interacting regime with a dynamical background field."
