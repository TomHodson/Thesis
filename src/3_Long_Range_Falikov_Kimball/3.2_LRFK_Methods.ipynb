    "At this stage one might think we're done. We can indeed draw independent samples from $P(\\s; \\beta)$ by starting from some arbitrary initial state and doing $k$ steps to arrive at a sample. However a key insight is that after the convergence time, every state generated  is a sample from $P(\\s; \\beta)$! They are not, however, independent samples. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:raw} it is already clear that the samples of the order parameter m have some auto-correlation because only a few spins are flipped each step but even when the number of spins flipped per step is increased, Fig.~\\ref{fig:m_autocorr} shows that it can be an important effect near the phase transition. Let's define the auto-correlation time $\\tau(O)$ informally as the number of MCMC samples of some observable O that are statistically equal to one independent sample or equivalently as the number of MCMC steps after which the samples are correlated below some cutoff, see\\ [@krauthIntroductionMonteCarlo1996] for a more rigorous definition involving a sum over the auto-correlation function.

There are many methods in the literature for estimating the true variance of $\\qex{O}$ and deciding how many steps are needed but my approach has been to run a small number of parallel chains, which are independent, in order to estimate the statistical error produced. This is a slightly less computationally efficient because it requires throwing away those $k$ steps generated before convergence multiple times but it is a conceptually simple workaround.\n",

We observe that for $N = 50$, the matrix diagonalisation, if it occurs, occupies around 60% of the total computation time for a single step. This rises to 90% at N = 300 and further increases for larger N. We therefore get the greatest speedup for large system sizes at low temperature where many prospective transitions are rejected at the classical stage and the matrix computation takes up the greatest fraction of the total computation time. The upshot is that we find a speedup of up to a factor of 10 at the cost of very little extra algorithmic complexity."

This reduces the number of rejected states, which brings the algorithm closer in efficiency to a direct sampling method. However it comes at the expense of requiring a way to directly sample from this complex distribution, a problem which MCMC was employed to solve in the first place. For example, recent work trains restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) to generate samples for the proposal distribution of the FK model\\ [@huangAcceleratedMonteCarlo2017]. The RBMs are chosen as a parametrisation of the proposal distribution that can be efficiently sampled from while offering sufficient flexibility that they can be adjusted to match the target distribution.

In this simulation the MCMC step is defined differently: an attempt is made to flip n spins, where n is drawn from Uniform(1,N). This is repeated $N^2/100$ times for each step. This trades off computation time for storage space, as it makes the samples less correlated, giving smaller statistical error for a given number of stored samples. These simulations therefore have the potential to necessitate $N^2/100$ matrix diagonalisations for every MCMC sample, though this can be cut down with caching and other tricks. $t = 1, \\alpha = 1.25, T = 2.2, J = U = 5$ [\\[fig:single\\]]{#fig:single label=\"fig:single\"}](figs/lsr/single.pdf){#fig:single width=\"\\\\columnwidth\"}\n",

We start in some initial state $\\s_0$ and then repeatedly jump to new states according to the probabilities given by $\\T$. This defines a set of random walks $\\{\\s_0\\ldots \\s_i\\ldots \\s_N\\}$. Fig. [2](#fig:single){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:single\"} shows this in practice: we have a (rather small) ensemble of $M = 2$ walkers starting at the same point in state space and then spreading outwards by flipping spins along the way.\n",

We need to carefully choose $\\T$ such that after a large number of steps $k$ (the convergence time) the probability $p_t(\\s;\\s_0)$ approaches the thermal distribution $P(\\s; \\beta) = \\Z^{-1} e^{-\\beta F(\\s)}$.

It can be shown that they have real eigenvalues, and ordering them by magnitude, that $\\lambda_0 = 1$ and $0 < \\lambda_{i\\neq0} < 1$. Assuming $\\T$ has been chosen correctly, its single eigenvector with eigenvalue 1 will be the thermal distribution [^3] so repeated application of the transition function eventually leads there, while memory of the initial conditions decays exponentially with a convergence time $k$ determined by $\\lambda_1$. In practice this means that one throws away the data from the beginning of the random walk in order reduce the dependence on the initial conditions and be close enough to the target distribution.\n",

    "## Auto-correlation Time\n",

    "![(Upper) 10 MCMC chains starting from the same initial state for a system with $N = 150$ sites and 3000 MCMC steps. At each MCMC step, n spins are flipped where n is drawn from Uniform(1,N) and this is repeated $N^2/100$ times. The simulations therefore have the potential to necessitate $10*N^2$ matrix diagonalisations for each 100 MCMC steps. (Lower) The normalised auto-correlation $(\\expval{m_i m_{i-j}} - \\expval{m_i}\\expval{m_i}) / Var(m_i))$ averaged over $i$. It can be seen that even with each MCMC step already being composed of many individual flip attempts, the auto-correlation is still non negligible and must be taken into account in the statistics. $t = 1, \\alpha = 1.25, T = 2.2, J = U = 5$ [\\[fig:m_autocorr\\]]{#fig:m_autocorr label=\"fig:m_autocorr\"}](figs/lsr/m_autocorr.png){#fig:m_autocorr width=\"\\\\columnwidth\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage one might think we're done. We can indeed draw independent samples from $P(\\s; \\beta)$ by starting from some arbitrary initial state and doing $k$ steps to arrive at a sample. However a key insight is that after the convergence time, every state generated is a sample from $P(\\s; \\beta)$! They are not, however, independent samples. In Fig. [1](#fig:raw){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:raw\"} it is already clear that the samples of the order parameter m have some auto-correlation because only a few spins are flipped each step but even when the number of spins flipped per step is increased, Fig. [3](#fig:m_autocorr){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:m_autocorr\"} shows that it can be an important effect near the phase transition. Let's define the auto-correlation time $\\tau(O)$ informally as the number of MCMC samples of some observable O that are statistically equal to one independent sample. [^4] The auto-correlation time is generally shorter than the convergence time so it therefore makes sense from an efficiency standpoint to run a single walker for many MCMC steps rather than to run a huge ensemble for $k$ steps each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the random walk has been carried out for many steps, the expectation values of $O$ can be estimated from the MCMC samples $\\s_i$: $$\\tex{O} = \\sum_{i = 0}^{N} O(\\s_i) + \\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}})$$ The the samples are correlated so the N of them effectively contains less information than $N$ independent samples would, in fact roughly $N/\\tau$ effective samples. As a consequence the variance is larger than the $\\qex{O^2} - \\qex{O}^2$ form it would have if the estimates were uncorrelated. There are many methods in the literature for estimating the true variance of $\\qex{O}$ and deciding how many steps are needed but my approach has been to run a small number of parallel chains, which are independent, in order to estimate the statistical error produced. This is a slightly less computationally efficient because it requires throwing away those $k$ steps generated before convergence multiple times but it is a conceptually simple workaround.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, to do efficient simulations we want to reduce both the convergence time and the auto-correlation time as much as possible. In order to explain how, we need to introduce the Metropolis-Hasting (MH) algorithm and how it gives an explicit form for the transition function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "MH breaks up the transition function into a proposal distribution $q(\\s \\to \\s')$ and an acceptance function $\\A(\\s \\to \\s')$. $q$ needs to be something that we can directly sample from, and in our case generally takes the form of flipping some number of spins in $\\s$, i.e if we're flipping a single random spin in the spin chain, $q(\\s \\to \\s')$ is the uniform distribution on states reachable by one spin flip from $\\s$. This also gives the nice symmetry property that $q(\\s \\to \\s') = q(\\s' \\to \\s)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposal $\\s'$ is then accepted or rejected with an acceptance probability $\\A(\\s \\to \\s')$, if the proposal is rejected then $\\s_{i+1} = \\s_{i}$. Hence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\T(x\\to x') = q(x\\to x')\\A(x \\to x')$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When the proposal distribution is symmetric as ours is, it cancels out in the expression for the acceptance function and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is simply the choice: $$\\A(x \\to x') = \\min\\left(1, e^{-\\beta\\;\\Delta F}\\right)$$ Where $F$ is the overall free energy of the system, including both the quantum and classical sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the acceptance function in practice we pick a random number in the unit interval and accept if it is less than $e^{-\\beta\\;\\Delta F}$:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we can discuss how to minimise the auto-correlations. The general principle is that one must balance the proposal distribution between two extremes. Choose overlay small steps, like flipping only a single spin and the acceptance rate will be high because $\\Delta F$ will usually be small, but each state will be very similar to the previous and the auto-correlations will be high too, making sampling inefficient. On the other hand, overlay large steps, like randomising a large portion of the spins each step, will result in very frequent rejections, especially at low temperatures.\n",
