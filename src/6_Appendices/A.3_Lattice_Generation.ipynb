    "Three key pieces of information allow us to represent amorphous lattices. The majority of the graph connectivity is encoded by an ordered list of edges $(i,j)$. These are ordered to represent both directed and undirected graphs. This is useful for defining the sign of bond operators $u_{ij} = - u_{ji}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information about the embedding of the lattice onto the torus is encoded into a point on the unit square associated with each vertex. The torus is unwrapped onto the square by defining an arbitrary pair of cuts along the major and minor axes. For simplicity, we take these axes to be the lines $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. We can wrap the unit square back up into a torus by identifying the lines $x = 0$ with $x = 1$ and $y = 0$ with $y = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to encode the topology of the graph. This is necessary because, if we are simply given an edge $(i, j)$ we do not know how the edge gets from vertex i to vertex j. One method would be taking the shortest path, but it could also 'go the long way around' by crossing one of the cuts. To encode this information, we store an additional vector $\\vec{r}$ associated with each edge. $r_i^x = 0$ means that edge i does not cross the x. $r_i^x = +1$ ($-1$) means it crossed the cut in a positive (negative) sense."

    "This description of the lattice has a very nice relationship to Bloch's theorem. Applying Bloch's theorem to a periodic lattice essentially means wrapping the unit cell onto a torus. Variations that happen at longer length scales than the size of the unit cell are captured by the crystal momentum. The crystal momentum inserts a phase factor $e^{i \\vec{q}\\cdot\\vec{r}}$ onto bonds that cross to adjacent unit cells. The vector $\\vec{r}$ is exactly what we use to encode the topology of our lattices.\n",

To solve this in practice I use a solver called `MiniSAT`\\ [@imms-sat18]. Like most modern SAT solvers, `MiniSAT` requires the input problem to be specified in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). CNF requires that the constraints be encoded as a set of _clauses_ of the form\n",

    "\n",
    "When translating problems to CNF form, there is often some flexibility. For instance, we used three boolean variables to encode the colour of each edge and then additional constraints to require that only one of these variables be true. An alternative method which we did not try would be to encode the label of each edge using two variables, yielding four states per edge, and then add a constraint that one of the states, say (true, true) is disallowed. This would, however, have added some complexity to the encoding of the constraint that no adjacent edges can have the same colour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The popular _Networkx_ Python library uses a greedy graph colouring algorithm. It simply iterates over the vertices/edges/faces of a graph and assigns them a colour that is not already disallowed. This does not work for our purposes because it is not designed to look for a particular n-colouring. However, it does include the option of using a heuristic function that determine the order in which vertices will be coloured\\ [@kosowski2004classical; @matulaSmallestlastOrderingClustering1983].
