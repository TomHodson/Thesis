Examples of direct sampling methods range from the trivial: take n random bits to generate integers uniformly between 0 and $2^n$ to more complex methods such as inverse transform sampling and rejection sampling\\ [@devroyeRandomSampling1986]. \n",

    "Now we can discuss how to minimise the auto-correlations. The general principle is that one must balance the proposal distribution between two extremes. Choose overlay small steps, like flipping only a single spin and the acceptance rate will be high because $\\Delta F$ will usually be small, but each state will be very similar to the previous and the auto-correlations will be high too, making sampling inefficient. On the other hand, overlay large steps, like randomising a large portion of the spins each step, will result in very frequent rejections, especially at low temperatures. \n",

    "I evaluated a few different proposal distributions for use with the FK model. \n",

    "1. Flipping a single random site\n",
    "1. Flipping N random sites for some N\n",
    "1. Choosing n from Uniform(1, N) and then flipping n sites for some fixed N.\n",
    "1. Attempting to tune the proposal distribution for each parameter regime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fro @fig:autocorr_multiple_proposals we see that even at moderately high temperatures $T > T_c$ flipping one or two sites is the best choice. However for some simulations at very high temperature flipping more spins is warranted."
