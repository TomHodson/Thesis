    "(Bond Sector) A state in the bond sector is specified by assigning $\\pm 1$ to each edge of the lattice. However, this description has a substantial gauge degeneracy. We can simplify things by decomposing each state into the product of three kinds of objects: (Vortex Sector) Only a small number of bonds need to be flipped (compared to some arbitrary reference) to reconstruct the vortex sector. Here, the edges are chosen from a spanning tree of the dual lattice, so there are no loops. (Gauge Field) The 'loopiness' of the bond sector can be factored out. This gives a network of loops that can always be written as a product of the gauge operators $D_j$. (Topological Sector) Finally, there are two loops that have no effect on the vortex sector, nor can they be constructed from gauge symmetries. These can be thought of as two fluxes $\\Phi_{x/y}$ that thread through the major and minor axes of the torus. Measuring $\\Phi_{x/y}$ amounts to constructing Wilson loops around the axes of the torus. We can flip the value of $\\Phi_{x}$ by transporting a vortex pair around the torus in the $y$ direction, as shown here. In each of the three figures on the right, black bonds correspond to those that must be flipped. Composing the three together gives back the original bond sector on the left.\n",

Again, there are only $2^{V-1}$ of these because, as we will see in the next section, $\\prod_{j} D_j = \\mathbb{1}$ in the physical space. We enforce this by choosing the correct product of single particle fermion states. One can get an intuitive picture for why $\\prod_{j} D_j = \\mathbb{1}$ by imagining larger and larger patches of $D_j$ operators on the torus. These patches correspond to transporting a vortex pair around the edge of the patch. At some point, the patch wraps around and starts to cover the entire torus. As this happens, the boundary of the patch disappears and, hence, it  corresponds to the identity operation. See @fig:flood_fill and @fig:flood_fill_amorphous.\n",

Along with that mapping comes a gauge field $u_{jk}$ defining __bond sectors__. The gauge symmetries of $u_{jk}$ are generated by the set of $D_j$ operators. The gauge invariant, and, therefore, physically, relevant variables are the plaquette operators $\\phi_i$ which define as a __vortex sector__. To solve the Majorana Hamiltonian, we must remove hats from the gauge field by restricting ourselves to a particular bond sector. At this stage, the Majorana Hamiltonian becomes non-interacting and we can solve it like any quadratic theory. This lets us construct the single particle eigenstates from which we can also construct many body states. Yet, the many body states constructed in this way are not in the physical subspace! "
