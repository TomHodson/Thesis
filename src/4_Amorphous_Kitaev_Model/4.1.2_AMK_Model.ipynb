    "(Bond Sector) A state in the bond sector is specified by assigning $\\pm 1$ to each edge of the lattice. However, this description has a substantial gauge degeneracy. We can simplify things by decomposing each state into the product of three kinds of objects: (Vortex Sector) Only a small number of bonds need to be flipped (compared to some arbitrary reference) to reconstruct the vortex sector. Here, the edges are chosen from a spanning tree of the dual lattice, so there are no loops. (Gauge Field) The 'loopiness' of the bond sector can be factored out. This gives a network of loops that can always be written as a product of the gauge operators $D_j$. (Topological Sector) Finally, there are two loops that have no effect on the vortex sector, nor can they be constructed from gauge symmetries. These can be thought of as two fluxes $\\Phi_{x/y}$ that thread through the major and minor axes of the torus. Measuring $\\Phi_{x/y}$ amounts to constructing Wilson loops around the axes of the torus. We can flip the value of $\\Phi_{x}$ by transporting a vortex pair around the torus in the $y$ direction, as shown here. In each of the three figures on the right, black bonds correspond to those that must be flipped. Composing the three together gives back the original bond sector on the left.\n",

    "However, in the non-Abelian phase we have to wrangle with monodromy\\ [@chungExplicitMonodromyMoore2007; @oshikawaTopologicalDegeneracyNonAbelian2007]. Monodromy is the behaviour of objects as they move around a singularity. This manifests here in that the identity of a vortex and cloud of Majoranas can change as we wind them around the torus in such a way that, rather than annihilating to the vacuum, we annihilate them to create an excited state instead of a ground state. This means that we end up with only three degenerate ground states in the non-Abelian phase $(+1, +1), (+1, -1), (-1, +1)$\\ [@chungTopologicalQuantumPhase2010; @yaoAlgebraicSpinLiquid2009]. Concretely, this is because the projector enforces both flux and fermion parity. When we wind a vortex around both non-contractible loops of the torus, it flips the flux parity. Therefore, we have to introduce a fermionic excitation to make the state physical. Hence, the process does not give a fourth ground state."
