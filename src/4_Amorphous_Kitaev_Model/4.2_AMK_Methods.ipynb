    "A simple method is to use a Voronoi partition of the torus [@mitchellAmorphousTopologicalInsulators2018; @marsalTopologicalWeaireThorpeModels2020; @florescu_designer_2009]. We start by sampling _seed points_ uniformly (or otherwise) on the torus. Then, we compute the partition of the torus into regions closest (with a Euclidean metric) to each seed point. The straight lines (if the torus is flattened out) at the borders of these regions become the edges of the new lattice. The points where they intersect become the vertices. \n",
    "\n",
    "The graph generated by a Voronoi partition of a two dimensional surface is always planar. This means that no edges cross each other when the graph is embedded into the plane. It is also trivalent in that every vertex is connected to exactly three edges __cite__.\n",

    "Ideally, we would sample uniformly from the space of possible trivalent graphs. Indeed, there has been some work on how to do this using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach [@alyamiUniformSamplingDirected2016]. However, it does not guarantee that the resulting graph is planar, which we must ensure so that the edges can be 3-coloured.\n",

To compute the Voronoi partition of the torus, we take the seed points and replicate them into a repeating grid. This will be either 3x3 or, for very small numbers of seed points, 5x5. Then, we identify edges in the output to construct a lattice on the torus."

    "Information about the embedding of the lattice onto the torus is encoded into a point on the unit square associated with each vertex. The torus is unwrapped onto the square by defining an arbitrary pair of cuts along the major and minor axes. For simplicity, we take these axes to be the lines $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. We can wrap the unit square back up into a torus by identifying the lines $x = 0$ with $x = 1$ and $y = 0$ with $y = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to encode the topology of the graph. This is necessary because, if we are simply given an edge $(i, j)$ we do not know how the edge gets from vertex i to vertex j. One method would be taking the shortest path, but it could also 'go the long way around' by crossing one of the cuts. To encode this information, we store an additional vector $\\vec{r}$ associated with each edge. $r_i^x = 0$ means that edge i does not cross the x. $r_i^x = +1$ ($-1$) means it crossed the cut in a positive (negative) sense."

    "\n",
    "To find colourings, we use a Boolean Satisfiability Solver or SAT solver. A SAT problem is a set of statements about some number of boolean variables , such as \"$x_1$ or not $x_3$ is true\", and looks for an assignment $x_i \\in {0,1}$ that satisfies all the statements [@Karp1972].\n",

Such programs are useful because, by the Cook-Levin theorem, any NP problem can be encoded in polynomial time as an instance of a SAT problem . This property is what makes SAT one of the subset of NP problems called NP-Complete [@cookComplexityTheoremprovingProcedures1971; @levin1973universal].\n",

Our three-edge-colouring problem is likely not in NP. However, since we do not know what special structure it might have that could be used to speed up its solution, using a SAT solver appears to be a reasonable first method to try. As will be discussed later, this turned out to work well enough and looking for a better solution was not necessary."
