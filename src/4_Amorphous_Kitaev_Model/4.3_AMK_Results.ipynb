Finite size effects have a large energetic contribution for small systems\\ [@kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006] so we would like to perform our analysis for very large lattices. However for an amorphous system with $N$ plaquettes, $2N$ edges and $3N$ vertices we have $2^{N-1}$ flux sectors to check and diagonalisation scales with $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$.

    "To get around this we instead look at periodic systems with amorphous unit cells. For a similarly sized periodic system with $A$ unit cells and $B$ plaquettes in each unit cell where $N \\sim AB$ things get much better. We can use Bloch's theorem to diagonalise this system in about $\\mathcal{O}(A B^3)$ operations, and more importantly there are only $2^{B-1}$ flux sectors to check. We fully enumerated the flux sectors of $\\sim$ 25,000 periodic systems with disordered unit cells of up to $B = 16$ plaquettes and $A = 100$ unit cells. However, showing that our guess is correct for periodic systems with disordered unit cells is not quite convincing on its own as we have effectively removed longer-range disorder from our lattices.\n",

    "The second part of the argument is to show that the energetic effect of introducing periodicity scales away as we go to larger system sizes and has already diminished to a small enough value at 16 plaquettes, which is indeed what we find. From this we argue that the results for small periodic systems generalise to large amorphous systems. In the isotropic case ($J^\\alpha = 1$), Lieb's theorem correctly predicts the ground state flux sector for all of the lattices we tested. For the toric code phase ($J^x = J^y = 0.25, J^z = 1$) all but around ($\\sim 0.5 \\%$) lattices had ground states conforming to our conjecture. In these cases, the energy difference between the true ground state and our prediction was on the order of $10^{-6} J$."

    "In this chapter we have looked at an extension of the KH model to amorphous lattices with coordination number three. We discussed a method to construct arbitrary trivalent lattices using Voronoi partitions, how to embed them onto the torus and how to edge-colour them using a SAT solver. We showed numerically that the ground state flux sector of the model is given by a simple extension of Lieb's theorem. The model has two gapped QSL phases. The two phases support excitations with different anyonic statistics, Abelian and non-Abelian, distinguished using a real-space generalisation of the Chern number\\ [@peru_preprint]. The presence of odd-sided plaquettes in the model resulted in spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry, leading to the emergence of a chiral spin liquid phase. Finally we showed evidence that the amorphous system undergoes an Anderson transition to a thermal metal phase, driven by the proliferation of vortices with increasing temperature. The AK model is an exactly solvable model of the chiral QSL state, one of the first models to exhibit a topologically non-trivial quantum many-body phase on an amorphous lattice. As such this study provides a number of future lines of research.\n",

    "We should consider whether a physical amorphous system that supports a QSL ground state could exist. The search for translation invariant Kitaev systems is already motivated by the prospect of a physically realised QSL state, Majorana fermions and direct access to a system with emergent $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge physics\\ [@TrebstPhysRep2022]. An amorphous Kitaev model would provide all this and in addition the possibility of exploring the CSL state and potentially very different routes to a physical realisation. One route would be to ask if any crystalline Kitaev material candidates can be heated and rapidly quenched\\ [@Weaire1976; @Petrakovski1981; @Kaneyoshi2018] to produce amorphous analogues that might preserve enough of their local structure to support a QSL state. \n",

    "Considering more designer materials, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) could present a platform for a synthetic Kitaev material. These materials are composed of repeating units of large organic molecules coordinated with metal ions. Amorphous MOFs can be generated with mechanical processes that introduce disorder into crystalline MOFs\\ [@bennett2014amorphous] and there have been recent proposals for realising strong Kitaev interactions\\Â [@yamadaDesigningKitaevSpin2017] in them as potential signatures of a resonating valence bond QSL state in MOFs with Kagome geometry\\ [@misumiQuantumSpinLiquid2020]. Finally, MOFs are composed of large synthetic molecules so may provide more opportunity for fine tuning to target particular physics than with ionic compounds. There have also been proposals to realise Kitaev physics in optical lattice experiments\\ [@duanControllingSpinExchange2003; @micheliToolboxLatticespinModels2006] which can also support amorphous lattices\\ [@sadeghiAmorphousTwodimensionalOptical2005].\n",
    "\n",
    "A physical realisation in either an amorphous compound or a MOF would likely entail a high degree of defects. Amorphous silicon, for instance, tends to contain dangling bonds which must be passivated by hydrogenation to improve its physical properties\\ [@streetHydrogenatedAmorphousSilicon1991]. In both cases, if we assume that Kitaev physics can be realised by crystalline systems, it is not clear if the necessary superexchange couplings would survive the addition of disorder to the lattice. It would therefore make sense theoretically to examine how robust the CSL ground state of the AK model is to additional disorder in the Hamiltonian, for example mis-colourings of the bonds, vertex degree disorder and disorder in coupling strengths. Relatedly, one could look at perturbations to the Hamiltonian that break integrability\\ [@Rau2014; @Chaloupka2010; @Chaloupka2013; @Chaloupka2015; @Winter2016].\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering experimental signatures, we expect that the chiral amorphous QSL will display a half-quantised thermal Hall effect similar to the magnetic field induced behaviour of KH materials\\Â [@Kasahara2018; @Yokoi2021; @Yamashita2020; @Bruin2022]. Alternatively, the CSL state could be characterised by local probes such as spin-polarised scanning tunnelling microscopy\\Â [@Feldmeier2020; @Konig2020; @Udagawa2021] while the thermal metal phase displays characteristic longitudinal heat transport signatures\\ [@Beenakker2013]. Local perturbations, such as those that might come from an atomic force microscope, could potentially be used to create and control vortices\\ [@jangVortexCreationControl2021]. To this end it one could look at how the move to amorphous lattices affects vortex time dynamics in perturbed KH models\\ [@joyDynamicsVisonsThermal2022].\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the lack of unambiguous signatures of the QSL state, it can be hard to distinguish the effects of the QSL state from the effect of disorder. So introducing topological disorder may only increase the experimental challenges. Three dimensional realisations could get around this as they would be expected to have a true Finite-Temperature Phase Transition (FTPT) to the thermal metal state that could be a useful experimental signature\\ [@eschmannThermodynamicClassificationThreedimensional2020; @OBrienPRB2016]. Three dimensional Kitaev systems can also support CSL ground states\\ [@mishchenkoChiralSpinLiquids2020].\n",

    "The KH model can be extended to 3D either on trivalent lattices\\ [@eschmannThermodynamicClassificationThreedimensional2020; @OBrienPRB2016] or it can be generalised to an exactly solvable spin-$\\tfrac{3}{2}$ model on 3D four-coordinate lattices\\ [@yaoAlgebraicSpinLiquid2009; @wenQuantumOrderStringnet2003; @ryuThreedimensionalTopologicalPhase2009; @Baskaran2008; @Nussinov2009; @Yao2011; @Chua2011; @Natori2020; @Chulliparambil2020; @Chulliparambil2021; @Seifert2020; @WangHaoranPRB2021; @Wu2009]. In\\ [@yaoAlgebraicSpinLiquid2009], the 2D square lattice with 4 bond types ($J_w, J_x, J_y, J_z$) is considered. Since Voronoi partitions in 3D produce lattices of degree four, one interesting generalisation of this work would be to look at the spin-$\\tfrac{3}{2}$ Kitaev model on amorphous lattices.\n",

    "We did not perform a full Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation of the AK model at finite temperature but the possible extension to a 3D model with an FTPT would motivate this full analysis. This MCMC simulation would be a numerically challenging task but poses no conceptual barriers\\ [@Laumann2012; @lahtinenTopologicalLiquidNucleation2012; @selfThermallyInducedMetallic2019]. Doing this would, first, allow one to look for possible violations of the Harris criterion\\ [@harrisEffectRandomDefects1974] for the Ising transition of the flux sector. Recall that topological disorder in 2D has radically different properties to that of other kinds of disorder due to the constraints imposed by the Euler equation and maintaining coordination number which allows it to violate otherwise quite general rules like the Harris criterion\\ [@barghathiPhaseTransitionsRandom2014; @schrauthViolationHarrisBarghathiVojtaCriterion2018]. Second, incorporating the projector in addition to MCMC would allow for a full investigation of whether the effect of topological degeneracy is apparent at finite temperatures, this is done for the KH model in\\ [@selfThermallyInducedMetallic2019].\n",

    "Next, one could investigate whether a QSL phase may exist for other models defined on amorphous lattices with a view to more realistic prospects of observation. Do the properties of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model generalise from the honeycomb to the amorphous case?\\ [@Chaloupka2010; @Chaloupka2015; @Jackeli2009; @Kalmeyer1989; @manousakisSpinTextonehalfHeisenberg1991] Alternatively we might look at other lattice construction techniques. For instance we could construct lattices by linking close points\\ [@agarwala2019topological] or create simplices from random sites\\ [@christRandomLatticeField1982]. Lattices constructed using these methods would likely have a large number of lattice defects where $z \\neq 3$ in the bulk, leading to many localised Majorana zero modes.\n",

    "We found a small number of lattices for which Lieb's theorem did not correctly predict the true ground state flux sector. I see two possibilities for what could cause this. Firstly it could be a a finite size effect that is amplified by certain rare lattice configurations. It would be interesting to try to elucidate what lattice features are present when Lieb's theorem fails. Alternatively, it might be telling that the ground state conjecture failed in the toric code A phase where the couplings are anisotropic. We showed that the colouring does not matter in the B phase. However an avenue that I did not explore was whether the particular choice of colouring for a lattice affects the physical properties in the toric code A phase. It is possible that some property of the particular colouring chosen is what leads to these rare failures of Lieb's theorem.\n",

    "Overall, there has been surprisingly little research on amorphous quantum many-body phases despite there being plenty of material candidates. I expect the exact chiral amorphous spin liquid to find many generalisations to realistic amorphous quantum magnets."
