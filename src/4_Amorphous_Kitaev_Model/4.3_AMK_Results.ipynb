We can use Bloch's theorem to diagonalise this system in about $\\mathcal{0}(A B^3)$ operations, and more importantly there are only $2^{B-1}$ flux sectors to check. We fully enumerated the flux sectors of ~25,000 periodic systems with disordered unit cells of up to $B = 16$ plaquettes and $A = 100$ unit cells. However, showing that our guess is correct for periodic systems with disordered unit cells is not quite convincing on its own as we have effectively removed longer-range disorder from our lattices.\n",

    "__Limits of the ground state conjecture__\n",
    "\n",
    "We found a small number of lattices for which the ground state conjecture did not correctly predict the true ground state flux sector. I see two possibilities for what could cause this. Firstly it could be a a finite size effect that is amplified by certain rare lattice configurations. It would be interesting to try to elucidate what lattice features are present when the ground state conjecture fails. Alternatively, it might be telling that the ground state conjecture failed in the toric code A phase where the couplings are anisotropic. We showed that the colouring does not matter in the B phase. However an avenue that I did not explore was whether the particular choice of colouring for a lattice affects the physical properties in the toric code A phase. It is possible that some property of the particular colouring chosen is what leads to failure of the ground state conjecture here.\n",

    "\"Three-dimensional Kitaev models distinguish themselves from their two-dimensional counterparts not only with regard to the variety of possible Majorana metals, but also with regard to the physics of their underlying Z2 gauge theory. One striking difference between two and three spatial dimensions arises when considering the effect of thermal fluctuations on the order of the Z2 gauge field. In two spatial dimensions such thermal fluctuations immediately melt the zero-temperature order of the Z2 gauge field, while for three spatial dimensions it takes a critical strength of the thermal fluctuations to destroy the Z2 order, i.e. there is a finite-temperature transition separating a low-temperature Z2 ordered state from a high-temperature disordered state. The origin for the absence/occurrence of such a finite-temperature transition in two/three spatial dimensions can readily be understood when considering the nature of defects in the lowtemperature Z2 gauge order. In two spatial dimensions, e.g. for the honeycomb lattice, the elementary excitations are point-like vison excitations (associated with the plaquettes of the honeycomb lattice) that can freely move through the lattice (at no additional energy cost) and thereby thread a flux line through the system which destroys the long-range order of the Z2 gauge field. For three spatial dimensions, the elementary vison excitations form closed flux loops, which leads to a competition between their excitation energy and configurational entropy. As a consequence, it takes a finite temperature to drive the system out of a regime of short flux loops into a regime of extended flux lines, which is connected to the paramagnetic high-temperature regime. In the context of the Kitaev model, this Z2 gauge physics has been nicely demonstrated [276,288–292] via numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations [288] (in the sign-problem free Majorana basis) of the Kitaev model for the entire family of three-dimensional tricoordinated lattices mentioned above. These finite-temperature simulations in fact reveal not only the Z2 gauge transition at a temperature scale of about\"\n",

As a result, the elementary plaquette flux must be ±π /2 for the Majorana fermions (which by the virtue of their complex hopping amplitude pick up a phase of ±π /2 per bond when traversing an elementary loop). This in turn implies a spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry in the ground state – akin to the physics of the Yao–Kivelson model on the decorated honeycomb model [265] – with the effect that a three-dimensional chiral spin liquid forms as ground state [292].\""
