    "Like other exactly solvable models\\ [@smithDisorderFreeLocalization2017], the FK model possesses extensively many conserved degrees of freedom $[d^\\dagger_{i}d_{i}, H] = 0$. Similarly, the Kitaev model contains an extensive number of conserved fluxes. So in both models, the Hilbert space breaks up into a set of sectors in which these operators take a definite value. Crucially, this reduces the interaction terms in the model from being quartic in fermion operators to quadratic. This is what makes the two models exactly solvable, in contrast to the Hubbard model. For the FK model the interaction term $(d^\\dagger_{i}d_{i} - \\tfrac{1}{2})\\;(c^\\dagger_{i}c_{i} - \\tfrac{1}{2})$ becomes quadratic when $d^\\dagger_{i}d_{i}$ is replaced with on of its eigenvalues $\\{0,1\\}$. The same thing happens in the Kitaev model, though after first applying a clever transformation which we will discuss later. "

For strong interactions $U >> t$, the spins are not ordered but nevertheless their interaction with the electrons opens a gap, leading to a Mott insulator analogous to that of the Hubbard model\\ [@brandtThermodynamicsCorrelationFunctions1989].

In the 1D FK model this means the whole spectrum is localised at all finite temperatures\\ [@goldshteinPurePointSpectrum1977; @abrahamsScalingTheoryLocalization1979; @kramerLocalizationTheoryExperiment1993].

If this value is negative it implies that the ordered state is unstable with respect to domain wall defects, and they will thus proliferate, destroying the ordered phase. If we consider the scaling of the two terms with system size $L$ we see that short range interactions produce a constant energy penalty $\\Delta E$ for a domain wall. In contrast, the number of such single domain wall states scales linearly with system size so the entropy is $\\propto \\ln L$. Thus the entropic contribution dominates (eventually) in the thermodynamic limit and no finite temperature order is possible. In 2D and above, the energy penalty of a large domain wall scales like $L^{d-1}$ which is why they can support ordered phases.  This argument does not quite apply to the FK model because of the aforementioned RKKY interaction. Instead this argument will give us insight into how to recover an ordered phase in the 1D FK model."
