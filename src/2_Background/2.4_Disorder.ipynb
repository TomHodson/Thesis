    "Both MBL and Anderson localisation depend crucially on the presence of quenched disorder. This has led to ongoing interest in the possibility of disorder-free localisation, in which the disorder necessary to generate localisation is generated entirely from the dynamics of the model. This contracts with typical models of disordered systems in which disorder is explicitly introduced into the Hamilton or the initial state. \n",

The idea is that the heavier particles act as an effective disorder potential for the lighter ones, inducing localisation. Two such models\\ [@yaoQuasiManyBodyLocalizationTranslationInvariant2016; @schiulazDynamicsManybodyLocalized2015] instead find that the models thermalise exponentially slowly in system size, which Ref.\\ [@yaoQuasiManyBodyLocalizationTranslationInvariant2016] dubs Quasi-MBL. \n",
