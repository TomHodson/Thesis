    "A very simple way to do this is to use a Voronoi partition of the torus [@mitchellAmorphousTopologicalInsulators2018; @marsalTopologicalWeaireThorpeModels2020; @florescu_designer_2009]. We start by sampling _seed points_ uniformly (or otherwise) on the torus. We then compute the partition of the torus into regions closest (with a Euclidean metric) to each seed point. The straight lines (if the torus is flattened out) at the borders of these regions become the edges of the new lattice and the points where they intersect beceme the vertices. \n",

I then identify edges in the output to construct a lattice on the torus."

    "In this section we detail the numerical evidence collected to support the claim that, for an arbitrary lattice, a gapped ground state flux sector is found by setting the flux through each plaquette to $\\phi_{\\textup{g.s.}} = -(\\pm i)^{n_{\\textup{sides}}}$. This was done by generating a large number ($\\sim$ 25,000) of lattices and exhaustively checking every possible flux sector to find the configuration with the lowest energy. We checked both the isotropic point ($J^\\alpha = 1$), as well as in the toric code phase ($J^x = J^y = 0.25, J^z = 1$).\\par \n",
    "The argument has one complication: for a graph with $n_p$ plaquettes, there are $2^{n_p - 1}$ distinct flux sectors to search over, with an added factor of 4 when the global fluxes $\\Phi_x$ and $\\Phi_y$ are taken into account. Note that the $-1$ appears in this counting because fluxes can only be flipped in pairs. To be able to search over the entire flux space, one is necessarily restricted to looking at small system sizes -- we were able to check all flux sectors for systems with $n_p \\leq 16$ in a reasonable amount of time. However, at such small system size we find that finite size effects are substantial enough to destroy our results. In order to overcome these effects we tile the system and use Bloch's theorem (a trick that we shall refer to as \\textit{twist-averaging} for reasons that shall become clear) to efficiently find the energy of a much larger (but periodic) lattice. Thus we are able to suppress finite size effects, at the expense of losing long-range disorder in the lattice.\\par\n",
    "Our argument has three parts: First we shall detail the techniques used to exhaustively search the flux space for a given lattice. Next, we discuss finite-size effects and explain the way that our methods are modified by the twist-averaging procedure. Finally, we demonstrate that as the size of the disordered system is increased, the effect of twist-averaging becomes negligible -- suggesting that our conclusions still apply in the case of large disordered lattices. \n",

    "In our numerical investigation, the objective was to test as many example lattices as possible. We aim for the largest lattice size that could be efficiently solved, requiring a balance between lattice size and cases tested. Each added plaquette doubles the number of flux sectors that must be checked. 25,000 lattices containing 16 plaquettes were used. However, in his numerical investigation of the honeycomb model, Kitaev demonstrated that finite size effects persist up to much larger lattice sizes than we were able to access \\cite{kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006}. \\par \n",
    "In order to circumvent this problem, we treat the 16-plaquette amorphous lattice as a unit cell in an arbitrarily large periodic system. The bonds that originally connected across the periodic boundaries now connect adjacent unit cells. This infinite periodic Hamiltonian can then be solved using Bloch's theorem, since the larger system is diagonalised by a plane wave ansatz. For a given crystal momentum $\\bf q \\in [0,2\\pi)^2 $, we are left with a Bloch Hamiltonian, which is identical to the original Hamiltonian aside from an extra phase on edges that cross the periodic boundaries in the $x$ and $y$ directions,\n",

Finally $q_{jk} = 0$ if the edge does not cross any boundaries at all -- in essence we are imposing twisted boundary conditions on our system. The total energy of the tiled system can be calculated by summing the energy of $M(\\bf q)$ for every value of $\\bf q$. In practice we constructed a lattice of $50 \\times 50$ values of $\\bf q$ spanning the Brillouin zone. The procedure is called twist averaging because the energy-per-unit cell is equivalent to the average energy over the full range of twisted boundary conditions. \\par \n",

    "For each lattice with 16 plaquettes, $2^{15} =$ 32,768 flux sectors are generated. In each case we find the energy (averaged over all twist values) and the size of the fermion gap, which is defined as the lowest energy excitation for any value of $\\bf q$. We then check if the lowest energy flux sector aligns with our ansatz (eqn.~\\ref{eqn:gnd_flux}) and whether this flux sector is gapped. \\par\n",
    "In the isotropic case ($J^\\alpha = 1$), all 25,000 examples conformed to our guess for the ground state flux sector. A tiny minority ($\\sim 10$) of the systems were found to be gapless. As we shall see shortly, the proportion of gapless systems vanishes as we increase the size of the amorphous lattice. An example of the energies and gaps for one of the systems tested is shown in fig.~\\ref{fig:energy_gaps_example}. For the anisotropic phase (we used $ J^x, J^y = 0.25, J^z = 1$) the overwhelming majority of cases adhered to our ansatz, however a small minority ($\\sim 0.5 \\%$) did not. In these cases, however, the energy difference between our ansatz and the ground state was at most of order $10^{-6}$. Further investigation would need to be undertaken to determine whether these anomalous systems are a finite size effect due to the small amorphous system sizes used or a genuine feature of the toric code phase on such lattices. \\par\n",

    "{\\it A Gapped Ground State ---} Now that we have collected sufficient evidence to support our guess for the ground state flux sector, we turn our attention to checking that this sector is gapped. We no longer need to exhaustively search over flux space for the ground state, so it is possible to go to much larger system size. We generate 40 sets of systems with plaquette numbers ranging from 9 to 1600. For each system size, 1000 distinct lattices are generated and the energy and gap size are calculated without phase twisting, since the effect is negligible for such large system sizes. As can be seen, for very small system size a small minority of gapless systems appear, however beyond around 20 plaquettes all systems had a stable fermion gap in the ground state. \n",

    "% Thus, we shall begin with a discussion of how finite size affects the eigenvalues of the Majorana Hamiltonian, followed by our solution to this problem.

    "% A gauge transformation involves flipping the value of $u_{jk}$ for the three bonds connected to the point at $j$. Under a gauge transformation, the matrix $M$ transforms according to $M \\rightarrow D_j M D_j$, where the matrix $D_j$ is a diagonal matrix with $-1$ on the $j$'th entry, and $+1$ on all others. This represents a unitary transformation, so the spectrum of $M$ is invariant under gauge transformations. As demonstrated in \\cite{Lieb2004}, the spectrum is determined entirely by the flux through all circuits in the system, which we define analogously to \\ref{eqn:flux_definition}. In this case we include not only plaquettes, but circuits that encircle several plaquettes. In periodic boundaries we must also consider \n",

Secondly, unlike tthe fluxes, which are defined for individual plaquettes, the weights are  calculated for every closed path on the lattice. The takeaway is that the characteristic polynomial, and thus all eigenvalues, is determined only by the values of these weights. Any change to the set of $u_{jk}$ that does not affect the weight of any cycles will have no effect on the energies of the system. For example a gauge transformation, where $u_{jk}$ is flipped on the three edges connected to a chosen site, cannot affect the energies, as every cycle passing through the chosen site must contain two of the flipped edges. \\par\n",
