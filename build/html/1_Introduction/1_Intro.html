<p>This thesis is composed of two main studies of separate but related
physical models, The Falikov-Kimball Model and the Kitaev-Honeycomb
Model. In this chapter I will discuss the overarching motivations for
looking at these two physical models. I will then review the literature
and methods that are common to both models.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2 I will look at the Falikov-Kimball model. I will review
what it is and why we would want to study it. I’ll survey what is
already known about it and identify the gap in the research that we aim
to fill, namely the model’s behaviour in one dimension. I’ll then
introduce the modified model that we came up with to close this gap. I
will present our results on the thermodynamic phase diagram and
localisation properties of the model</p>
<p>In Chapter 3 I’ll study the Kitaev Honeycomb Model, following the
same structure as Chapter 2 I will motivate the study, survey the
literature and identify a gap. I’ll introduce our Amorphous Kitaev Model
designed to fill this gap and present the results.</p>
<p>Finally in chapter 4 I will summarise the results and discuss what
implications they have for our understanding interacting many-body
quantum systems.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting and perhaps surprising features of many
body physics is the existence of distinct phases of matter.</p>
<p>Why does liquid turn to ice? Well there are two key ingredients.
First we need a system composed of a large number of objects and second
we need those objects to interact with eachother.</p>
<p>It turns out that the more objects there are, the greater the effect
that their interactions has on the whole. A hundred <span
class="math inline">\(H_2O\)</span> molecules can’t actually form the
nice regular structure that characterises ice, instead you’d get more of
a blob. However, any human scale amount of water contains an
unimaginable huge number of molecules.</p>
<p>Phases come about when the interactions between individuals
components serve the reinforce</p>
<p>When a many body, interacting system can display radically different
properties depending on the system parameters</p>
<p><strong>Themes</strong> - many body - interactions - quantum -
topology - disorder</p>

<li><p>quasiparticles</p></li>
<li><p>topological order</p></li>
<li><p>protected edge states</p></li>

<p>Condensed matter is called condensed because in the scheme of things
it is the physics of objects that are quite cold. Working at high
energies allows one to probe deeper and deeper into the substructure of
things, from atoms to nuclei to nucleons to quarks to gluons. At one
stage the behaviour may be well described by talking of protons and
neutrons binding together, while at the next it is necessary to bring
gluons and quarks into the picture.</p>
<p>It is perhaps not surprising then, that going to lower energies
produces the reverse effect. If we start with a gas of atoms and cool
it, we will get a solid. In that solid, we find that the relevant
objects are not even particles in the sense that one might imagine, they
are instead collective motions (or excitations) of the constituent
particles which we call quasiparticles.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is said that quasiparticles are a bit like waves on the
ocean. And in a sense they are, however because they live in the quantum
realm they are far weirder and more diverse than ocean waves. Their
quantumness gives them a distinct identity and indivisibility that waves
do not have. They can interact both directly and, more strangely, simply
by moving around one another.</p>
<p>I will be looking at the behaviour of electrons in crystalline and
amorphous materials. The ingredients that I will consider are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactions between particles</li>
<li>Disorder or randomness in the system</li>
<li>Symmetries of the system</li>
<li>The dimensionality of the system</li>
<li>Temperature</li>
<li>While perhaps obvious, the fact of there being many bodies is itself
a key ingredient.</li>
</ul>
<p>In keeping with the theme of trying to keep things simple, I will use
the tight binding approximation of electrons moving against a fixed
atomic background potential. I will discuss the advantages and
disadvantages of this approximation in the next chapter but for now
let’s say that it captures enough of the essence of reality to explain
many physical phenomena.</p>
<p><a href="venndiagram">Modelling reality requires three basic
ingredients: we need quantum objects, we need a lot of them and we need
them to interact. However these three properties taken together make for
an almost completely intractable problem. Many approaches to modelling
reality in condensed matter can be thought of as tackling this problem
by going after one of these ingredients. Diagrammatic methods set
interactions to zero and add them back in perturbatively. Mean field
methods get rid of the many bodies. Condensed matter theorists are
excited about ADS/CFT correspondences because the can map interacting
quantum problems onto classical ones. The models I study in this thesis
could be classified into this scheme as follows. The FK model model
contains many interacting bodies but what makes it tractable is that we
have classical species interacting with quantum ones, because the
quantum particles never interact among one another we can still make
progress with simulations. The Kitaev Honeycomb Model and our
generalisations of it essentially rely on a similar trick, though in
this case the classical degrees of freedom are emergent they still serve
to decouple the quantum degrees of freedom from interacting with one
another.</a></p>
<p><strong>Spin-Orbit Coupling</strong></p>
<p>Electronic wavefunctions can be understood as quantum extensions
of</p>
<p>This can be loosely understood as a consequence of that fact that
electrons are ‘orbiting’ their host nucleus and in doing so they are
moving with respect to an electric field generated by the positive
charge of the nucleus. The electric field looks like a magnetic field in
the rest frame of the electron and this magnetic field couples to the
magnetic spin moment of the electron.</p>
<p>This analogy is wrong on many levels but it suffices to understand
that there should be such an effect.</p>
<p>Going one level deeper we can estimate the scale of the effect by
combining the non-relativistic quantum theory of a spin in a magnetic
field with the classical relativistic electromagnetism prediction for
how the electric field turns into a magnetic field in the rest frame of
the electron. This gets us within a factor to two of the correct answer
but it fails to account for an extra relativistic effect called Thomas
Precession <strong>cite</strong>.</p>
<p>The next level would be to compute this effect within relativistic QM
using the Dirac equation. And finally, we could do the full calculation
within Quantum Electrodynamics where we would find tiny corrections that
come about from virtual processes involving particle-antiparticle pairs
that spring form from the vacuum.</p>

<p>These are easiest to understand within the context of the Hubbard
model, if we take spin <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> fermions
hopping on the lattice with hopping parameter <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and interaction strength <span
class="math inline">\(U\)</span> <span class="math display">\[ H = -t
\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle \alpha} c^\dagger_{i\alpha} c_{j\alpha} +
\sum_i c^\dagger_{i\uparrow} c_{i\downarrow}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(c^\dagger_{i\alpha}\)</span>
creates a spin <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> electron at
site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Pauli exclusion prevents
two electrons with the same spin being at the same site so which is why
the interaction term only couples opposite spin electrons. The only
physically relevant parameter here is <span
class="math inline">\(U/t\)</span> which compared the interaction
strength <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> to the importance of
kinetic energy <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the free fermion limit <span class="math inline">\(U/t =
0\)</span>, we can just find the single particle eigenstates and fill
them up to the fermi level. The many body ground state has no particular
electron-electron correlations.</p>
<p>In the interacting limit, <span class="math inline">\(t/U =
0\)</span>, there’s no hopping so electrons just site wherever we put
them. We can fill the system up until there is one electron per site
without any energy penalty at all. The maximum we can fill the system up
to</p>

<p><a href="energy_scales">A collection of important energy scales
plotted on a logarithmic scale. We can take room temperature somewhere
in the middle of the plot as a reference point. Moving towards higher
energies we’ll gradually probe deeper into the smaller and smaller
structures of the universe, atoms, protons, quarks etc. While going to
lower energies we move to larger and larger scales and objects made up
of progressively more and more components.</a></p>
<p>There’s a common joke among condensed matter physicists that the
field is the study of dirt. I quite like this definition because within
the average handful of dirt you’re not unlikely to find crystals,
metals, glasses and all manner of other things that condensed matter
physicists like to study.</p>
<p>The second reason I like this definition is that dirt is complex. It
has structure at many scales. It is heterogeneous and contaminated with
traces of all manner of things. It’s dirty. When I talk about real
physical things like this, I will use the word systems.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have mathematical tools at our disposal to
describe and understand the world around us. I’ll use the word model
whenever I am talking about these mathematical constructions that
describe the real word.</p>
<p>This leads one of the central tensions of condensed matter theory:
our models are ill-equipped to deal with the complexity inherent in the
real world. We may be able to write down a mathematical description of a
handful of dirt, but we wouldn’t be able to solve it. And a model we
cannot solve will not further our understanding.</p>
<p>So what do we do? Well, we simplify. We try to ask “What are the
essential ingredients required to model this particular phenomenon?”</p>
<p>Answering this question lets us write down simpler models that we
have a better chance of being able to solve. And by paring the
description down to the bare minimum, it also gives us a better chance
of being able to understand why these systems behave the way they
do.</p>
<p>I will therefore be focusing on highly simplified models of reality,
each containing only a few ingredients. I will then investigate what
phenomena can be observed in these models and try to relate the findings
to more messy reality.</p>
