  abstract = {This article is a brief introduction to the rapidly evolving field of many-body localization. Rather than giving an in-depth review of the subject, our aspiration here is simply to introduce the problem and its general context, outlining a few directions where notable progress has been achieved in recent years. We hope that this will prepare the readers for the more specialized articles appearing in the forthcoming dedicated volume of Annalen der Physik, where these developments are discussed in more detail.},

  abstract = {The gravitational-wave signal GW190521 is consistent with a binary black hole (BBH) merger source at redshift 0.8 with unusually high component masses, M{$\odot$} and M{$\odot$}, compared to previously reported events, and shows mild evidence for spin-induced orbital precession. The primary falls in the mass gap predicted by (pulsational) pair-instability supernova theory, in the approximate range 65\textendash 120 M{$\odot$}. The probability that at least one of the black holes in GW190521 is in that range is 99.0\%. The final mass of the merger ( M{$\odot$}) classifies it as an intermediate-mass black hole. Under the assumption of a quasi-circular BBH coalescence, we detail the physical properties of GW190521's source binary and its post-merger remnant, including component masses and spin vectors. Three different waveform models, as well as direct comparison to numerical solutions of general relativity, yield consistent estimates of these properties. Tests of strong-field general relativity targeting the merger-ringdown stages of the coalescence indicate consistency of the observed signal with theoretical predictions. We estimate the merger rate of similar systems to be . We discuss the astrophysical implications of GW190521 for stellar collapse and for the possible formation of black holes in the pair-instability mass gap through various channels: via (multiple) stellar coalescences, or via hierarchical mergers of lower-mass black holes in star clusters or in active galactic nuclei. We find it to be unlikely that GW190521 is a strongly lensed signal of a lower-mass black hole binary merger. We also discuss more exotic possible sources for GW190521, including a highly eccentric black hole binary, or a primordial black hole binary.},

We first check the validity of the relation connecting the critical behavior of the LR model with parameters (d,{$\sigma$}) to that of a short-range (SR) model in an equivalent dimension D. We then study the critical behavior of the d=2 LR model close to the lower critical {$\sigma$}, uncovering that the spatial correlation function decays with two different power laws: The effect of the subdominant power law is much stronger than finite-size effects and actually makes the estimate of critical exponents very subtle. By including this subdominant power law, the numerical data are consistent with the standard renormalization group (RG) prediction by Sak [Phys. Rev. B 8, 281 (1973)], thus making not necessary (and unlikely, according to Occam's razor) the recent proposal by Picco [arXiv:1207.1018] of having a new set of RG fixed points in addition to the mean-field one and the SR one.},

In these, the effect of spatially extended degrees of freedom is usually only taken into account in a mean field fashion or as a secondary effect. As a result, critical exponents associated with phase transitions have a mean field character. Here we demonstrate that diagrammatic multiscale methods anchored around local approximations are indeed capable of capturing the non-mean-field nature of the critical point of the lattice model encoded in a nonvanishing anomalous dimension and of correctly describing the transition to mean-field-like behavior as the number of spatial dimensions increases.},

Here, we establish that the two-dimensional Falicov-Kimball model, one of the simplest lattice models of strong electron correlation, does allow for the study of this interplay. In particular, we show that this model at particle-hole symmetry possesses three distinct thermodynamic insulating phases and exhibits Anderson localization. The previously reported metallic phase is identified as a finite-size feature due to the presence of weak localization. We characterize these phases by their electronic density of states, staggered occupation, conductivity, and the generalized inverse participation ratio. The implications of our findings for other strongly correlated systems are discussed.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging and optical microscopy are key technologies in the life sciences. For microbiological studies, especially of the inner workings of single cells, optical microscopy is normally used because it easily achieves resolution close to the optical wavelength. But in conventional microscopy, diffraction limits the resolution to about half the wavelength. Recently, it was shown that this limit can be partly overcome by nonlinear imaging techniques1,2, but there is still a barrier to reaching the molecular scale. In contrast, in magnetic resonance imaging the spatial resolution is not determined by diffraction; rather, it is limited by magnetic field sensitivity, and so can in principle go well below the optical wavelength. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging has recently been improved enough to image single cells3,4, and magnetic resonance force microscopy5 has succeeded in detecting single electrons6 and small nuclear spin ensembles7. However, this technique currently requires cryogenic temperatures, which limit most potential biological applications8. Alternatively, single-electron spin states can be detected optically9,10, even at room temperature in some systems11,12,13,14. Here we show how magneto-optical spin detection can be used to determine the location of a spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond with nanometre resolution under ambient conditions. By placing these nitrogen-vacancy spins in functionalized diamond nanocrystals, biologically specific magnetofluorescent spin markers can be produced. Significantly, we show that this nanometre-scale resolution can be achieved without any probes located closer than typical cell dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a single diamond spin as a scanning probe magnetometer to map nanoscale magnetic field variations. The potential impact of single-spin imaging at room temperature is far-reaching. It could lead to the capability to probe biologically relevant spins in living cells.},

For such materials, quantum effects define their physical behaviour and open completely new (quantum) perspectives for applications. Carbon-based materials are particularly good examples, highlighted by the fascinating quantum properties of, for example, nanotubes1 or graphene2. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis and application of ultrapure isotopically controlled single-crystal chemical vapour deposition (CVD) diamond with a remarkably low concentration of paramagnetic impurities. The content of nuclear spins associated with the 13C isotope was depleted to 0.3\% and the concentration of other paramagnetic defects was measured to be {$<$}1013 cm-3. Being placed in such a spin-free lattice, single electron spins show the longest room-temperature spin dephasing times ever observed in solid-state systems (T2=1.8 ms). This benchmark will potentially allow observation of coherent coupling between spins separated by a few tens of nanometres, making it a versatile material for room-temperature quantum information processing devices. We also show that single electron spins in the same isotopically engineered CVD diamond can be used to detect external magnetic fields with a sensitivity reaching 4 nT Hz-1/2 and subnanometre spatial resolution.},

In common with methods such as simulated tempering and Metropolis-coupled MCMC, the key idea is to utilise a series of successively easier to sample distributions to improve movement around the state space. Tempered transitions does this by incorporating moves through these less modal distributions into the MCMC proposals. Unfortunately the improved movement between modes comes at a high computational cost with a low acceptance rate of expensive proposals. We consider how the algorithm may be tuned to increase the acceptance rates for a given number of temperatures. We find that the commonly assumed geometric spacing of temperatures is reasonable in many but not all applications.},

Some of these phenomena, for example vortex lattice 'melting', pose serious problems for technological applications of the most anisotropic HTS materials and a fuller understanding of them is of considerable importance. The most direct information regarding vortex structures and dynamics is obtained through local measurement of the magnetic field within or at the surface of a superconducting sample. A detailed review of such local magnetic probes is presented here including Lorentz microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, Bitter decoration, scanning Hall probe microscopy, magneto-optical imaging, and scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy. In each case the principles underpinning the technique are described together with the factors that limit the magnetic field and the spatial and temporal resolution. A range of examples will be given, emphasizing applications in the area of HTSs. In addition the ways in which the existing techniques can be expected to develop over the next few years will be discussed and new approaches that seem likely to be successful described.},

  abstract = {The distribution functionP L (s) of the local order parameters in finite blocks of linear dimensionL is studied for Ising lattices of dimensionalityd=2, 3 and 4. Apart from the case where the block is a subsystem of an infinite lattice, also the distribution in finite systems with free [P L (f) (s)] and periodic [P L (p)(s) ] boundary conditions is treated. Above the critical pointT c , these distributions tend for largeL towards the same gaussian distribution centered around zero block magnetization, while belowT c these distributions tend towards two gaussians centered at {$\pm$}M, whereM is the spontaneous magnetization appearing in the infinite systems. However, belowT c the wings of the distribution at small |s| are distinctly nongaussian, reflecting two-phase coexistence. Hence the distribution functions can be used to obtain the interface tension between ordered phases.At criticality, the distribution functions tend for largeL towards scaled universal forms, though dependent on the boundary conditions. These scaling functions are estimated from Monte Carlo simulations. For subsystem-blocks, good agreement with previous renormalization group work of Bruce is obtained.As an application, it is shown that Monte Carlo studies of critical phenomena can be improved in several ways using these distribution functions:(i) standard estimates of order parameter, susceptibility, interface tension are improved(ii) T c can be estimated independent of critical exponent estimates(iii) A Monte Carlo ``renormalization group'' similar to Nightingale's phenomenological renormalization is proposed, which yields fairly accurate exponent estimates with rather moderate effort(iv) Information on coarse-grained hamiltonians can be gained, which is particularly interesting if the method is extended to more general Hamiltonians.},

The method is based on the recently found solution of the model that uses the Jordan?Wigner-type fermionization in an exact effective spin-hardcore boson representation. We specifically simulate the braiding of two non-Abelian vortices (anyons) in a four-vortex system characterized by a twofold degenerate ground state. The result of the braiding is the non-Abelian Berry matrix, which is in excellent agreement with the predictions of the effective field theory. The most precise results of our simulation are characterized by an error of the order of 10?5 or lower. We observe exponential decay of the error with the distance between vortices, studied in the range of one to nine plaquettes. We also study its correlation with the involved energy gaps and provide a preliminary analysis of the relevant adiabaticity conditions. The work allows one to investigate the Berry phase in other lattice models including the Yao?Kivelson model and particularly the square?octagon model. It also opens up the possibility of studying the Berry phase under non-adiabatic and other effects that may constitute important sources of errors in topological quantum computation.},

The latter, a so-called Ising phase, is related to topological superconductors. Its quasiparticle excitations, which are formed by Majorana fermions attached to vortices, show non-abelian fractional statistics and are known as Ising anyons. We investigate dislocation defects in the Ising phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model. After introducing them to the system, we accordingly generalize our solution of this model to the situation with the defects. The important part of this effort is developing an appropriate Jordan\textendash Wigner fermionization procedure. It is expected that the presence of defects manifests itself by the formation of fermionic zero-energy modes around the defect end points. We numerically confirm this expectation and further investigate properties of these modes. The computational potential of our technique is demonstrated for both diagonalization and dynamical simulations. The latter focuses on the process of fusion of the vortex zero-energy modes with the Majorana fermions attached to the defect. This process simulates fusion of non-abelian Ising anyons.},

In a single spatial dimension, the calculations are still tractable, and experiments have recently confirmed the prediction that sufficiently strong disorder can disrupt the transport of interacting particles. In two dimensions, however, the theoretical blueprint is missing. Choi et al. used single-site imaging of cold 87Rb atoms in an optical lattice to show that similar localization occurs in two-dimensional (2D) systems. The study highlights the power of quantum simulation to solve problems that are currently inaccessible to classical computing techniques. Science, this issue p. 1547 A fundamental assumption in statistical physics is that generic closed quantum many-body systems thermalize under their own dynamics. Recently, the emergence of many-body localized systems has questioned this concept and challenged our understanding of the connection between statistical physics and quantum mechanics. Here we report on the observation of a many-body localization transition between thermal and localized phases for bosons in a two-dimensional disordered optical lattice. With our single-site\textendash resolved measurements, we track the relaxation dynamics of an initially prepared out-of-equilibrium density pattern and find strong evidence for a diverging length scale when approaching the localization transition. Our experiments represent a demonstration and in-depth characterization of many-body localization in a regime not accessible with state-of-the-art simulations on classical computers.

  abstract = {This review gives a pedagogical introduction to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), its basis, and its implications to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. In the first part, ETH is introduced as a natural extension of ideas from quantum chaos and random matrix theory (RMT). To this end, we present a brief overview of classical and quantum chaos, as well as RMT and some of its most important predictions. The latter include the statistics of energy levels, eigenstate components, and matrix elements of observables. Building on these, we introduce the ETH and show that it allows one to describe thermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an external bath. We examine numerical evidence of eigenstate thermalization from studies of many-body lattice systems. We also introduce the concept of a quench as a means of taking isolated systems out of equilibrium, and discuss results of numerical experiments on quantum quenches. The second part of the review explores the implications of quantum chaos and ETH to thermodynamics. Basic thermodynamic relations are derived, including the second law of thermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, fluctuation theorems, and the Einstein and Onsager relations. In particular, it is shown that quantum chaos allows one to prove these relations for individual Hamiltonian eigenstates and thus extend them to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles. We then show how one can use these relations to obtain nontrivial universal energy distributions in continuously driven systems. At the end of the review, we briefly discuss the relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of integrable quantum systems, for which ETH is violated. We introduce the concept of the generalized Gibbs ensemble, and discuss its connection with ideas of prethermalization in weakly interacting systems.},

In particular, we consider in detail a class of slowly varying potential with a typical example being Vn={$\lambda$} cos({$\pi\alpha$}n{$\nu$}) with 0{$<\nu<$}1. We develop an asymptotic semiclassical technique to calculate exactly (in the large-n limit) the density of states and the Lyapunov exponent for this model. We also carry out numerical work involving direct diagonalization and recursive transfer-matrix calculations to study localization properties of the model. Our theoretical results are essentially in exact agreement with the numerical results. Our most important finding is that, for {$\lambda<$}2, there is a metal-insulator transition in this one-dimensional model ({$\nu<$}1) with the mobility edges located at energies Ec={$\pm\Vert$}2-{$\lambda\Vert$}. Eigenstates at the band center ({$\Vert$}E{$\Vert<\Vert$}Ec{$\Vert$}) are all extended whereas the band-edge states ({$\Vert$}E{$\Vert>\Vert$}Ec{$\Vert$}) are all localized. Another interesting finding is that, in contrast to higher-dimensional random-disorder situations, the density of states, D(E), in this model is not necessarily smooth through the mobility edge, but may diverge according to D(E){$\sim\Vert$}E-Ec{$\parallel-\delta$}. The Lyapunov exponent {$\gamma$} (or, the inverse localization length) behaves at Ec as {$\gamma$}(E){$\sim\Vert$}E-Ec{$\parallel\beta$}, with {$\beta$}=1-{$\delta$}. We solve the exact critical behavior of the general model, deriving analytic expressions for D(E), {$\gamma$}(E), and the exponents {$\delta$} and {$\beta$}. We find that {$\lambda$}, {$\alpha$}, and {$\nu$} are all irrelevant variables in the renormalization-group sense for the localization critical properties of the model.

However, in spite of its many outstanding demonstrations, the theory of the spin has not yet been fully developed, and there do not currently exist thorough explanations for many of its properties, such as the anisotropy of the electron g factor and the existence of Stark effects and strain splittings. In this work, the theory of the ground-state spin is fully developed using the molecular orbital theory of the center in order to provide detailed explanations for the spin's fine and hyperfine structures and its interactions with electric, magnetic, and strain fields. Given these explanations, a general solution is obtained for the spin in any given electric-magnetic-strain field configuration, and the effects of the fields on the spin's coherent evolution, relaxation, and inhomogeneous dephasing are examined. Thus, this work provides the essential theoretical tools for the precise control and modeling of this remarkable spin in its current and future applications.},

The experimental results are in good agreement with a simplified model of the NV defect spin dynamics, leading to an optimized sensitivity around 2{$\mu$}T/{$\surd$}Hz for a single NV defect in a high-purity diamond crystal grown by chemical vapor deposition. We then demonstrate an enhancement of the magnetic sensitivity by one order of magnitude by using a simple pulsed-ESR scheme. This technique is based on repetitive excitation of the NV defect with a resonant microwave {$\pi$} pulse followed by an optimized readout laser pulse, allowing to fully eliminate power broadening of the ESR linewidth. The achieved sensitivity is similar to that obtained by using Ramsey-type sequences, which is the optimal magnetic field sensitivity for the detection of a dc magnetic field.},

It provides a route to simulate the physics of the Hamiltonian and to address open questions and novel challenges of the underlying many-body system.

  abstract = {Electron tunneling across the surface potential barrier has been applied for many years to probe surface atomic and electronic structure. This had led, for example, to the development of the field emission microscope, and more recently, of electron tunneling spectroscopy of insulating barriers in MIM structures. Some four years ago, Binning, Rohrer and coworkers developed the first vacuum tunneling microscope with atomic resolution. In this device, electrons tunnel across a vacuum gap between a sample surface and a scanning tip. Since then, a growing number of research groups have constructed such devices. The STM has provided detailed insight into the atomic structure of surfaces. The feasibility of scanning tunnel spectroscopy (STS) has been demonstrated, though fewer results have been reported. However, before the full potential of the twin techniques of STM and STS can be realized, two problems have to be resolved: (1) A more quantitative, but tractable theory, has to be developed to permit an unambiguous interpretation of the data. (2) A more reliable procedure for the preparation of the tip has to be developed to assure the quantitative reproducibility of the data. A critical review of tunneling theory and the transfer Hamiltonian formalism is presented. Inelastic and elastic resonant tunneling are discussed. The construction and operation of the STM are briefly described. The transfer Hamiltonian theory of the device is reviewed. The concept of surface corrugation is also discussed. Recent results by Kuk on the dependence of the observed corrugation amplitude on the atomic structure of the scanning tip are analyzed. Lastly, image potential states and their significance in the STS study of the electronic structure of the surface barrier are considered.},

In addition, it is shown that the total energy and the specific heat can also be measured in O(N) time. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm over the conventional method and the O(NlogN) algorithm by Luijten and Bl\"ote.

Then these diagrams have been translated into the canonical ensemble. Compared to the diagrams obtained in other studies our ones contain more details, in particular they give better insight into the way the mixtures of periodic phases are formed. Our study has revealed several families of new characteristic phases like the generalized most homogeneous and the generalized crenel phases, a first example of a structural phase transition and a tendency to build up an additional symmetry -- the hole-particle symmetry with respect to the ions (electrons) only, as \$U\$ decreases.},

The effect of interactions are addressed by Kohn's theorem regarding de Haas-van Alphen oscillations, which states that electron-electron interactions cannot affect the oscillation frequencies as long as disorder is neglected and the system is sufficiently screened, which should be valid for chemical potentials not very close to the Dirac point. We determine the positions of Landau levels in the presence of potential disorder from exact transfer matrix and finite size diagonalization calculations. The positions are shown to be unshifted even for moderate disorder; stronger disorder, can, however, lead to shifts, but this also appears minimal even for disorder width as large as one-half of the bare hopping matrix element on the graphene lattice. Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations of the conductivity are calculated analytically within a self-consistent Born approximation of impurity scattering. The oscillatory part of the conductivity follows the widely invoked Lifshitz-Kosevich form when certain mass and frequency parameters are properly interpreted.},

Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose\textendash Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.},

It describes in particular a system of spinless quantum particles interacting with classical particles (Ising spins). In this review we present the progress which has been accomplished in the last decade concerning this model, with an emphasis on rigorous results. Our discussion includes the one, two, and three dimensional cases. We also show how certain techniques can be applied to other related models such as the static Holstein and Kondo models. Their common feature with the Falicov-Kimball model is that they consist of itinerant spinless electrons interacting with a classical field, associated with either a discrete Ising spin, a continuous scalar spin or a vector field. Finally we discuss a generalized Falicov-Kimball model of spin one-half electrons with on-site Hubbard interaction and interacting also with classical particles, as well as different models where the fermions are replaced by hard-core bosons. For the last class of models the interactions are truly many body but a limited number of rigorous results can be obtained using reflection positivity. The main issues discussed in this review concern the structure of ground states for the classical particles, and how they are affected by magnetic fluxes (via orbital coupling) and quantum statistics. Perturbative as well as non perturbative methods are used.}

In this chapter we review how topological phases have been recently shown to emerge in amorphous systems. We summarize the properties of topological states and discuss how disposing of translational invariance has motivated the surge of new tools to characterize topological states in amorphous systems, both theoretically and experimentally. The ubiquity of amorphous systems combined with the robustness of topology has the potential to bring new fundamental understanding in our classification of phases of matter, and inspire new technological developments.},

We map these systems onto a model of free fermions coupled to strictly localized spin-1/2 degrees of freedom. At finite temperature the localized degrees of freedom act as emergent disorder and localize the fermions. Although the model can be analyzed using free-fermion techniques, it has dynamical signatures in common with typical many-body localized systems: Starting from generic initial states, entanglement grows logarithmically; in addition, equilibrium dynamical correlation functions decay with an exponent that varies continuously with temperature and model parameters. These quasi-1D models offer an experimentally realizable setting in which natural dynamical probes show signatures of disorder-free many-body localization.},

  abstract = {Quantum spin liquids have fascinated condensed matter physicists for decades because of their unusual properties such as spin fractionalization and long-range entanglement. Unlike conventional symmetry breaking the topological order underlying quantum spin liquids is hard to detect experimentally. Even theoretical models are scarce for which the ground state is established to be a quantum spin liquid. The Kitaev honeycomb model and its generalizations to other tri-coordinated lattices are chief counterexamples --- they are exactly solvable, harbor a variety of quantum spin liquid phases, and are also relevant for certain transition metal compounds including the polymorphs of (Na,Li)\$\_2\$IrO\$\_3\$ Iridates and RuCl\$\_3\$. In this review, we give an overview of the rich physics of the Kitaev model, including 2D and 3D fractionalization as well as dynamical correlations and behavior at finite temperatures. We discuss the different materials, and argue how the Kitaev model physics can be relevant even though most materials show magnetic ordering at low temperatures.},

As in the case of single-site dynamical mean field theory, thermalization is absent in DCA simulations, and for quenches across the metal-insulator boundary, nearest-neighbor charge correlations in the nonthermal steady state are found to be larger than in the thermal state with identical energy. We investigate to what extent it is possible to define an effective temperature of the trapped state after a quench. Based on the ratio between the lesser and retarded Green's function we conclude that a roughly thermal distribution is reached within the energy intervals corresponding to the momentum-patch dependent subbands of the spectral function. The effectively different chemical potentials of these distributions however lead to a very hot, or even negative, effective temperature in the energy intervals between these subbands.},

At higher temperature, the initial spreading is determined by the Fermi velocity of the noninteracting system and the maximum range of the correlations decreases with increasing interaction strength. Charge order correlations in the disorder potential enhance the range of the correlations. We also use the numerically exact lattice Monte Carlo results to benchmark the accuracy of equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamical cluster approximation calculations.

One of the simplest settings to study this physics is given by the Falikov-Kimball model, which describes itinerant fermions interacting with a classical Ising background field. Despite the translational invariance of the model, inhomogenous configurations of the background field give rise to effective disorder physics which lead to a rich phase diagram in two (or more) dimensions with finite temperature charge density wave (CDW) transitions and interaction-tuned Anderson versus Mott localized phases. Here, we propose a generalised Falikov-Kimball model in one dimension with long-range interactions which shows a similarly rich phase diagram. We use an exact Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to map the phase diagram and compute the energy resolved localisation properties of the fermions. We compare the behaviour of this transitionally invariant model to an Anderson model of uncorrelated binary disorder about a background CDW field which confirms that the fermionic sector only fully localizes for very large system sizes.},

Typically, these micro-cantilever systems are operated in three open-loop modes; non-contact mode, contact mode, and tapping mode. In order to probe electric, magnetic, and/or atomic forces of a selected sample, the non-contact mode is utilized by moving the cantilever slightly away from the sample surface and oscillating the cantilever at or near its natural resonance frequency. Alternatively, the contact mode acquires sample attributes by monitoring interaction forces while the cantilever tip remains in contact with the target sample. The tapping mode of operation combines qualities of both the contact and non-contact modes by gleaning sample data and oscillating the cantilever tip at or near its natural resonance frequency while allowing the cantilever tip to impact the target sample for a minimal amount of time. Recent research on AFM systems has focused on many manufacturing and metrology processes at molecular levels due to its tremendous surface microscopic capabilities. This paper provides a review of such recent developments in AFM imaging system with emphasis on operational modes, micro-cantilever dynamic modeling and control. Due to the important contributions of AFM systems to metrology and biological sciences, this study also provides a comprehensive review of recent applications of different AFM systems in these two important areas.},

Furthermore, we identify that spin-spin interaction between nitrogen-vacancy centers and substitutional nitrogen atoms in the diamond leads to changes in the line shape and the linewidth of the optically detected magnetic resonance signals.

  abstract = {Strong interactions between electrons in a solid material can lead to surprising properties. A prime example is the Mott insulator, in which suppression of conductivity occurs as a result of interactions rather than a filled Bloch band1. Proximity to the Mott insulating phase in fermionic systems is the origin of many intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics2, most notably high-temperature superconductivity3. The Hubbard model4, which encompasses the essential physics of the Mott insulator, also applies to quantum gases trapped in an optical lattice5,6. It is therefore now possible to access this regime with tools developed in atomic physics. However, an atomic Mott insulator has so far been realized only with a gas of bosons7, which lack the rich and peculiar nature of fermions. Here we report the formation of a Mott insulator of a repulsively interacting two-component Fermi gas in an optical lattice. It is identified by three features: a drastic suppression of doubly occupied lattice sites, a strong reduction of the compressibility inferred from the response of double occupancy to an increase in atom number, and the appearance of a gapped mode in the excitation spectrum. Direct control of the interaction strength allows us to compare the Mott insulating regime and the non-interacting regime without changing tunnel-coupling or confinement. Our results pave the way for further studies of the Mott insulator, including spin-ordering and ultimately the question of d-wave superfluidity6,8.},

Local Markov-chain Monte Carlo, as proposed by Metropolis et al. in 1953, appears as a sequence of random walks in high-dimensional polytopes, while the moves of the more powerful event-chain algorithm correspond to molecular dynamics evolution. We determine the convergence properties of Monte Carlo methods in a special invariant polytope associated with hard-disk configurations, and the implications for convergence of hard-disk sampling. Finally, we discuss parallelization strategies for event-chain Monte Carlo and present results for a multicore implementation.},

We employ a Jordan-Wigner-type fermionization and find that the Hamiltonian takes a BCS-type form, allowing the system to be solved by Bogoliubov transformation. Our fermionization does not employ nonphysical auxiliary degrees of freedom and the eigenstates we obtain are completely explicit in terms of the spin variables. The ground state is obtained as a BCS condensate of fermion pairs over a vacuum state which corresponds to the toric-code state with the same vorticity. We show in detail how to calculate all eigenstates and eigenvalues of the model on the torus. In particular, we find that the topological degeneracy on the torus descends directly from that of the toric-code, which now supplies four vacua for the fermions, one for each choice of periodic vs antiperiodic boundary conditions. The reduction of the degeneracy in the non-Abelian phase of the model is seen to be due to the vanishing of one of the corresponding candidate BCS ground states in that phase. This occurs in particular in the fully periodic vortex-free sector. The true ground state in this sector is exhibited and shown to be gapped away from the three partially antiperiodic ground states whenever the non-Abelian phase is gapped.},

(It can be viewed as a modified Hubbard model in which the spin-up electrons are not allowed to hop.) The electron-nucleus potential is ``on-site'' only. Neither this potential alone nor the kinetic energy alone can produce long range order. Thus, if long range order exists in this model it must come from an exchange mechanism. N, the electron plus nucleus number, is taken to be less than or equal to the number of lattice sites. We prove the following: (i) For all dimensions, d, the ground state has long range order; in fact it is a perfect crystal with spacing {$\surd$}2 times the lattice spacing. A gap in the ground state energy always exists at the half-filled band point (N = number of lattice sites). (ii) For small, positive temperature, T, the ordering persists when d {$\geqslant$} 2. If T is large there is no long range order and there is exponential clustering of all correlation functions.},

Conventional light-emitting systems such as dye molecules and semiconductor quantum dots could also be used for this purpose, but they suffer from lack of photostability. However, colour centres in diamond have been found to be remarkably stable against bleaching and blinking effects.

This topic has important connections to combinatorics, statistical physics, and theoretical computer science. Many of the techniques presented originate in these disciplines.  The central tools for estimating convergence times, including coupling, strong stationary times, and spectral methods, are developed. The authors discuss many examples, including card shuffling and the Ising model, from statistical mechanics, and present the connection of random walks to electrical networks and apply it to estimate hitting and cover times.  The first edition has been used in courses in mathematics and computer science departments of numerous universities. The second edition features three new chapters (on monotone chains, the exclusion process, and stationary times) and also includes smaller additions and corrections throughout. Updated notes at the end of each chapter inform the reader of recent research developments.},

  abstract = {In order to test the validity of various techniques and formalisms  developed for treating many-particle systems, a model is constructed which is simple enough to be solved exactly in some cases, but yet is non-trivial. The construction of such models is based on the observation that bilinear products of creation and annihilation operators can be considered as generators of Lie groups. Thus the problem of finding eigenvalues can be greatly simplified by the additional integrals of the motion which are present if the Hamiltonian is constructed so as to commute with invariants of the group. In the present case, the model consists of N fermions distributed in two N-fold degenerate levels and interacting via a monopole-monopole force. It is shown that the model Hamiltonian is easily expressed in terms of quasi-spin operators and exact eigenvalues are obtained. In addition, eigenvalues are calculated with ordinary perturbation theory using values for the number of particles and interaction strength which are appropriate to the more realistic problems of finite nuclei. In subsequent papers we consider the results obtained by various other approximation methods for comparison with the exact results presented here.}

  abstract = {The spin-{$\frac{1}{2}$} antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice is used to describe the dynamics of the spin degrees of freedom of undoped copper oxides. Even though the model lacks an exact solution, a solid, accurate, and rather conventional picture emerges from a number of techniques\textemdash analytical (spin-wave theory, Schwinger boson mean-field theory, renormalization-group calculations), semianalytical (variational theory, series expansions), and numerical (quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, etc.). At zero temperature, the effect of the zero-point fluctuations is not strong enough to destroy the antiferromagnetic long-range order, despite the fact that we are dealing with a low-spin low-dimensional system. The corrections to the spin-wave theory, which treats perturbatively the effect of such fluctuations around the classical N\'eel ground state, appear to be small. At any nonzero temperature the order disappears and the correlation length at low temperature T(kBTJ{$\ll$}1, where J is the antiferromagnetic coupling) follows the singular form {$\xi$}(T)=Cexp({$\alpha$}JkBT). In the long-wavelength limit and at low T, the model has the same behavior as the quantum nonlinear {$\sigma$} model in two spatial dimensions and one Euclidean time dimension, which we also study with available analytical and Monte Carlo techniques. The quasiparticles of the theory are bosons; at low T and for wavelengths shorter than the correlation length they are welldefined spin-wave excitations. The spectrum of such excitations and the temperature-dependent correlation length have been determined by neutron and Raman scattering experiments done on La2CuO4. The good agreement of the experimental data with the predictions of this theory suggests that the magnetic state of the undoped materials is the conventional ordered state. We discuss, within a simple mean-field theory, the effect of weak three-dimensional antiferromagnetic coupling and the role of an antisymmetric term, introduced to explain a hidden ferromagnetic behavior of the uniform susceptibility. We find that understanding the copper-oxide antiferromagnetic insulator is only the first essential step towards the development of a theory of the superconductor created upon doping such materials.},

For example, doping an antiferromagnet is expected to give rise to pseudogap states and high-temperature superconductors1. Quantum simulation2,3,4,5,6,7,8 using ultracold fermions in optical lattices could help to answer open questions about the doped Hubbard Hamiltonian9,10,11,12,13,14, and has recently been advanced by quantum gas microscopy15,16,17,18,19,20. Here we report the realization of an antiferromagnet in a repulsively interacting Fermi gas on a two-dimensional square lattice of about 80 sites at a temperature of 0.25 times the tunnelling energy. The antiferromagnetic long-range order manifests through the divergence of the correlation length, which reaches the size of the system, the development of a peak in the spin structure factor and a staggered magnetization that is close to the ground-state value. We hole-dope the system away from half-filling, towards a regime in which complex many-body states are expected, and find that strong magnetic correlations persist at the antiferromagnetic ordering vector up to dopings of about 15 per cent. In this regime, numerical simulations are challenging21 and so experiments provide a valuable benchmark. Our results demonstrate that microscopy of cold atoms in optical lattices can help us to understand the low-temperature Fermi\textendash Hubbard model.},

This publication deals with the action of Markov chains on general state spaces. It discusses the theories and the use to be gained, concentrating on the areas of engineering, operations research and control theory. Throughout, the theme of stochastic stability and the search for practical methods of verifying such stability, provide a new and powerful technique. This does not only affect applications but also the development of the theory itself. The impact of the theory on specific models is discussed in detail, in order to provide examples as well as to demonstrate the importance of these models. Markov Chains and Stochastic Stability can be used as a textbook on applied Markov chain theory, provided that one concentrates on the main aspects only. It is also of benefit to graduate students with a standard background in countable space stochastic models. Finally, the book can serve as a research resource and active tool for practitioners.},

This stands in contrast to many commonly used materials such as silicon and aluminum, whose properties are comparatively unaffected by the Coulomb repulsion. Correlated materials often have remarkable properties and transitions between distinct, competing phases with dramatically different electronic and magnetic orders. These rich phenomena are fascinating from the basic science perspective and offer possibilities for technological applications. This article looks at these materials through the lens of research performed at Rice University. Topics examined include: Quantum phase transitions and quantum criticality in "heavy fermion" materials and the iron pnictide high temperature superconductors; computational ab initio methods to examine strongly correlated materials and their interface with analytical theory techniques; layered dichalcogenides as example correlated materials with rich phases (charge density waves, superconductivity, hard ferromagnetism) that may be tuned by composition, pressure, and magnetic field; and nanostructure methods applied to the correlated oxides VO2 and Fe3O4, where metal-insulator transitions can be manipulated by doping at the nanoscale or driving the system out of equilibrium. We conclude with a discussion of the exciting prospects for this class of materials.},

Here, it is shown how one can use the Markov chain transitions for such an annealing sequence to define an importance sampler. The Markov chain aspect allows this method to perform acceptably even for high-dimensional problems, where finding good importance sampling distributions would otherwise be very difficult, while the use of importance weights ensures that the estimates found converge to the correct values as the number of annealing runs increases. This annealed importance sampling procedure resembles the second half of the previously-studied tempered transitions, and can be seen as a generalization of a recently-proposed variant of sequential importance sampling. It is also related to thermodynamic integration methods for estimating ratios of normalizing constants. Annealed importance sampling is most attractive when isolated modes are present, or when estimates of normalizing constants are required, but it may also be more generally useful, since its independent sampling allows one to bypass some of the problems of assessing convergence and autocorrelation in Markov chain samplers.},

  abstract = {I present a new Markov chain sampling method appropriate for distributions with isolated modes. Like the recently developed method of `simulated tempering', the `tempered transition' method uses a series of distributions that interpolate between the distribution of interest and a distribution for which sampling is easier. The new method has the advantage that it does not require approximate values for the normalizing constants of these distributions, which are needed for simulated tempering, and can be tedious to estimate. Simulated tempering performs a random walk along the series of distributions used. In contrast, the tempered transitions of the new method move systematically from the desired distribution, to the easily-sampled distribution, and back to the desired distribution. This systematic movement avoids the inefficiency of a random walk, an advantage that is unfortunately cancelled by an increase in the number of interpolating distributions required. Because of this, the sampling efficiency of the tempered transition method in simple problems is similar to that of simulated tempering. On more complex distributions, however, simulated tempering and tempered transitions may perform differently. Which is better depends on the ways in which the interpolating distributions are `deceptive'.},

While the fractionalization of quantum numbers is one of the recurring themes in modern condensed matter physics, it often remains a challenge to devise a controlled analytical framework tracking this phenomenon. A notable exception is the exactly solvable Kitaev model, in which spin degrees of freedom fractionalize into Majorana fermions and a Z2 gauge field. Here we discuss the physics of fractionalization in three-dimensional Kitaev models and demonstrate that the itinerant Majorana fermions generically form a (semi)metal which, depending on the underlying lattice structure, exhibits Majorana Fermi surfaces, nodal lines or topologically protected Weyl nodes. We show that the nature of these Majorana metals can be deduced from an elementary symmetry analysis of the projective time-reversal and inversion symmetries for a given lattice. This allows us to comprehensively classify the gapless spin liquids of Kitaev models for the most elementary tricoordinated lattices in three dimensions. We further expand this classification by addressing the effects of time-reversal symmetry breaking and additional interactions.},

We then propose a simple model based on a layer of electron traps located at the ND surface which is in good agreement with the recorded statistics. By using thermal oxidation to remove the shell of amorphous carbon around the NDs, we demonstrate a significant increase in the proportion of NV- defects in 10 nm NDs.

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is well known as a powerful technique for visualizing subsurface structures with three-dimensional spatial resolution. Pushing the resolution below 1 \textmu m remains a major challenge, however, owing to the sensitivity limitations of conventional inductive detection techniques. Currently, the smallest volume elements in an image must contain at least 1012 nuclear spins for MRI-based microscopy1, or 107 electron spins for electron spin resonance microscopy2. Magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) was proposed as a means to improve detection sensitivity to the single-spin level, and thus enable three-dimensional imaging of macromolecules (for example, proteins) with atomic resolution3,4. MRFM has also been proposed as a qubit readout device for spin-based quantum computers5,6. Here we report the detection of an individual electron spin by MRFM. A spatial resolution of 25 nm in one dimension was obtained for an unpaired spin in silicon dioxide. The measured signal is consistent with a model in which the spin is aligned parallel or anti-parallel to the effective field, with a rotating-frame relaxation time of 760 ms. The long relaxation time suggests that the state of an individual spin can be monitored for extended periods of time, even while subjected to a complex set of manipulations that are part of the MRFM measurement protocol.},

We focus on two-dimensional systems with point-like random scatterers, but our methods are neither model nor dimension specific. We begin by showing that exact eigenstates cannot be efficiently used to extract the localisation length. We then provide a comprehensive review of known LLT, and show that the effective potential of LLT can, to some degree, replace the real potential in the Hamiltonian. Next, we use LLT to compute the localisation length and (manually) test our method against exact diagonalisation. Furthermore, we propose a transmission experiment that optimally detects Anderson localisation and link the simulated observations of such an experiment to the predictions of LLT. In addition, we study the dimensional crossover from one to two dimensions, providing a new explanation to the established trends. The prediction of a mobility edge coming from LLT is tested by direct Schr\textbackslash "odinger time evolution and is found to be unphysical. Moreover, we investigate expanding wavepackets, and find interesting differences between wavepackets that are initiated within and outside the disorder. We explain these differences using LLT combined with multidimensional tunnelling. Then, we utilise LLT to uncover a connection between the Anderson model for discrete disordered lattices and continuous two-dimensional disordered systems, which provides powerful new insights. From here, we demonstrate that localisation can be distinguished from other effects by a comparison to dynamics in an ordered potential with all other properties unchanged. Finally, we thoroughly investigate the effect of acceleration and repulsive interparticle interactions, as relevant for current experiments.},

Then, we reveal the physical significance of the effective potential of LLT, justifying the crucial role it plays in our new method. We proceed to use LLT to calculate the localisation length, as defined by the length-scale of exponential decay of the eigenstates, (manually) testing our findings against exact diagonalisation. We place our computational scheme in context by explaining the connection to the more general problem of multidimensional tunnelling and discussing the approximations involved.

The model we consider is an Ising ferromagnet on a square or cubic lattice with weak next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic (AFM) bonds and single-spin-flip dynamics. The AFM bonds introduce free-energy barriers to coarsening and thus greatly slow the dynamics. In two dimensions, the barriers are independent of the characteristic length scale L(t), and therefore the long-time (t\textrightarrow{$\infty$}) growth of L(t) still obeys the standard t1/2 law. However, in three dimensions, a simple physical argument suggests that for quenches below the corner-rounding transition temperature, TCR, the barriers are proportional to L(t) and thus grow as the system coarsens.

Here, we present a model with localization arising in a very simple, completely translationally invariant quantum model, with only local interactions between spins and fermions. By identifying an extensive set of conserved quantities, we show that the system generates purely dynamically its own disorder, which gives rise to localization of fermionic degrees of freedom. Our work gives an answer to a decades old question whether quenched disorder is a necessary condition for localization. It also offers new insights into the physics of many-body localization, lattice gauge theories, and quantum disentangled liquids.},

We provide diagnostics of this localization through a set of experimentally relevant dynamical measures, entanglement measures, as well as spectral properties of the model. One of the defining features of the models that we study is a binary nature of emergent disorder, related to \$\textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ degrees of freedom. This results in a qualitatively different behaviour in the strong disorder limit compared to typically studied models of localization. For example it gives rise to a possibility of a delocalization transition via a mechanism of quantum percolation in dimensions higher than 1D. We highlight the importance of our general phenomenology to questions related to dynamics of defects in Kitaev's toric code, and to quantum quenches in Hubbard models. While the simplest models we consider are effectively non-interacting, we also include interactions leading to many-body localization-like logarithmic entanglement growth. Finally, we consider effects of interactions that generate dynamics for conserved charges, which gives rise to only transient localization behaviour, or quasi-many-body-localization.},

We review the existing evidence, and show that previously neglected effects substantially strengthen the case for Berry's conjecture. We study a rarefied hard-sphere gas as an explicit example of a many-body system which is known to be classically chaotic, and show that an energy eigenstate which obeys Berry's conjecture predicts a Maxwell--Boltzmann, Bose--Einstein, or Fermi--Dirac distribution for the momentum of each constituent particle, depending on whether the wave functions are taken to be nonsymmetric, completely symmetric, or completely antisymmetric functions of the positions of the particles.

We show that a generic initial state will approach thermal equilibrium at least as fast as \$O(\textbackslash hbar/\textbackslash Delta)t\^\{-1\}\$, where \$\textbackslash Delta\$ is the uncertainty in the total energy of the gas. This result holds for an individual initial state; in contrast to the classical theory, no averaging over an ensemble of initial states is needed.

However, this technique is inherently limited to magnetic fields that are weak enough to avoid electron spin mixing. Here, we focus on the high off-axis magnetic field regime where spin mixing alters the NV defect spin dynamics. We first study, in a quantitative manner, the dependence of the NV defect optical properties on the magnetic field vector B . Magnetic-field-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements are compared to a seven-level model of the NV defect that accounts for field-induced spin mixing. The model reproduces decreases in (i) ESR contrast, (ii) PL intensity and (iii) excited level lifetime with an increasing off-axis magnetic field. We next demonstrate that these effects can be used to perform all-optical imaging of the magnetic field component | B {$\perp$} | orthogonal on the NV defect axis. Using a scanning NV defect microscope, we map the stray field of a magnetic hard disc through both PL and fluorescence lifetime imaging. This all-optical method for high magnetic field imaging at the nanoscale might be of interest in the field of nanomagnetism, where samples producing fields in excess of several tens of milliteslas are typically found.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) produces a correlated sample for estimating expectations with respect to a target distribution. A fundamental question is when should sampling stop so that we have good estimates of the desired quantities? The key to answering this question lies in assessing the Monte Carlo error through a multivariate Markov chain central limit theorem (CLT). The multivariate nature of this Monte Carlo error largely has been ignored in the MCMC literature. We present a multivariate framework for terminating simulation in MCMC. We define a multivariate effective sample size, estimating which requires strongly consistent estimators of the covariance matrix in the Markov chain CLT; a property we show for the multivariate batch means estimator. We then provide a lower bound on the number of minimum effective samples required for a desired level of precision. This lower bound depends on the problem only in the dimension of the expectation being estimated, and not on the underlying stochastic process. This result is obtained by drawing a connection between terminating simulation via effective sample size and terminating simulation using a relative standard deviation fixed-volume sequential stopping rule; which we demonstrate is an asymptotically valid procedure. The finite sample properties of the proposed method are demonstrated in a variety of examples.},

  abstract = {We describe an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm using a random walk in energy space to obtain a very accurate estimate of the density of states for classical statistical models. The density of states is modified at each step when the energy level is visited to produce a flat histogram. By carefully controlling the modification factor, we allow the density of states to converge to the true value very quickly, even for large systems. From the density of states at the end of the random walk, we can estimate thermodynamic quantities such as internal energy and specific heat capacity by calculating canonical averages at any temperature. Using this method, we not only can avoid repeating simulations at multiple temperatures, but we can also estimate the free energy and entropy, quantities that are not directly accessible by conventional Monte Carlo simulations. This algorithm is especially useful for complex systems with a rough landscape since all possible energy levels are visited with the same probability. As with the multicanonical Monte Carlo technique, our method overcomes the tunneling barrier between coexisting phases at first-order phase transitions. In this paper, we apply our algorithm to both first- and second-order phase transitions to demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy. We obtained direct simulational estimates for the density of states for two-dimensional ten-state Potts models on lattices up to 200\texttimes 200 and Ising models on lattices up to 256\texttimes 256. Our simulational results are compared to both exact solutions and existing numerical data obtained using other methods. Applying this approach to a three-dimensional {$\pm$}J spin-glass model, we estimate the internal energy and entropy at zero temperature; and, using a two-dimensional random walk in energy and order-parameter space, we obtain the (rough) canonical distribution and energy landscape in order-parameter space. Preliminary data suggest that the glass transition temperature is about 1.2 and that better estimates can be obtained with more extensive application of the method. This simulational method is not restricted to energy space and can be used to calculate the density of states for any parameter by a random walk in the corresponding space., This article appears in the following collection:},

In the last twenty years, however, there has been an emergence of a new paradigm associated with fractionalization, emergent gauge bosons and fermions, topological order, string-net condensation, and long range entanglements. These new physical concepts are so fundamental that they may even influence our understanding of the origin of light and electrons in the universe. This book is a pedagogical and systematic introduction to the new concepts and quantum field theoretical methods in condensed matter physics. It discusses many basic notions in theoretical physics which underlie physical phenomena in nature, including a notion that unifies light and electrons. Topics covered include dissipative quantum systems, boson condensation, symmetry breaking and gapless excitations, phase transitions, Fermi liquids, spin density wave states, Fermi and fractional statistics, quantum Hall effects, topological/quantum order, and spin liquid and string-net condensation. Methods discussed include the path integral, Green's functions, mean-field theory, effective theory, renormalization group, bosonization in one- and higher dimensions, non-linear sigma-model, quantum gauge theory, dualities, projective construction, and exactly soluble models beyond one-dimension.},

We show that this property can be, in finite dimensions, traced to a crossing of sharp states resulting from the single particle excitations of the localized subsystem. The analysis of the inverse participation ratio points to a strong localization in the discussed regime. However, the pronounced subgap density of states can still lead to a notable increase of charge transport through a finite size system. We show this by focusing on the transmission in heterostructures where a Falicov-Kimball system is sandwiched between two metallic leads.},
