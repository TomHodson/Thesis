Note that this is not an exhaustive list, there are many smaller fixes that I felt were better served by the latex diff instead.

Add phantom daggers for alignment in equations.
Make sure figures are referenced in the text.
Add punctuation after equations
Check how the cover page for the Ising model prints out
Make sure are names are capitalised (e.g Hall and Fermi)
Correction: The Toric code was the first exactly solved QSL model.
Replace "many body" with "many-body"
Use latexdiff to show changes
Changed title to "The Long-Range Falicov-Kimball Model and the Amorphous Kitaev Model: Quantum Many-Body Systems I have known and loved"
Global look for see ref to check ref is there
Fix chapter marker showing 5 when it should say appendices. 


Thesis Changelog 
================

Everywhere
----------
    - Added phantom daggers where necessary.
    - Changed title to "The Long-Range Falicov-Kimball Model and the Amorphous Kitaev Model: Quantum Many-Body Systems I have known and loved"
    - Use "i.e.," rather than variations,
    - Add hyphen to various things including, Half filling, Half filled etc.
    - Checked that Hall and other names are capitalised throughout the document while fermion etc are not.
    - Remove capitalisation of chemical elements.
    - Add appropriate punctuation after equations.
    - Fix cover page for chapter 2
    - Ensure "see ref. [25]" rather than  "see [25]"
    - Fix chapter header showing "Chapter 5" when it should say "Appendices". 

Introduction
------------
    - Added references to figures 1.2, 1.3
    - Mention that eq 1.3 is at half filling.
    - Clarify KH is only one of the early exactly solve-able QSL models.

Chapter 2
----------
    - Mention fig 2.1 in the text
    - Fix eqn 2.2
    - Fix figure 2.2 caption to refer to dimensions greater than one.
    - Rephrased last sentence of 2.1
    - Clarify wording of figure 2.5 caption
    - Fix arrow direction in figure 2.7
    - Fermions and Bosons -> fermions and bosons

Chapter 3
----------
    - Mention fig 3.1 and 3.2 in the text.
    - Fix mathmode m in fig 3.2 caption
    - Fix eqn 3.6
    - Add ylabel to fig 3.3, remove triangle
    - Mathmode in fig 3.4 caption


Chapter 4
-----------
    - fix fig 4.1 caption
    - Fig 4.4 the point appeared outside of the unit square because I was doing random perturbations without putting the points back in the unit square afterwards. This is now fixed.
