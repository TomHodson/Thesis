## Intro 

So towards the end of writing my thesis I was browsing around and I come across this paper

OK weird title but the author is a pretty well known and respected physicist (see wiki page), let's see what he has to say.... this thing is wild!

What follows is twelve pages of pretty wild stuff, most of the references are to himself but OK he did do a lot of cool stuff. 

What he proceeds to do is to make a very speculative argument about the the nature of reality and it starts like this...

(Sphere meme) So you're an experimental condensed matter physicist and you've managed to create this beautiful orb (artist's impression). Susskind says, OK let's imagine the field of condensed matter has advanced a few hundred years to the point where we can create a sphere with it's atoms arranged in just the right way that at the surface, the quantum state of all the electrons and atoms behave like something called a CFT. 

I won't go into detail about what a CFT is but suffice to say this isn't such a crazy thing to imagine. (For the physicists in the room, it's more likely you're simulate this sphere on a quantum computer but neither I nor Susskind think that that is as fun). If you've ever seen these clickbaity headlines that say something like "The universe might be a hologram, you are a mere shadow on some cosmic wall" this is roughly what they're wildly gesticulating at.

Now we know that some CFTs is a 2D quantum thing world (flatlander), but we know that CFTs are mathematically indistinguishable from a certain kind of 3D non-quantum world. We say that the CFT is dual to a 3D AdS spacetime. Now to say that Susskind takes this and runs with it a bit of an understatement, he takes this concept, puts it in a rocket and blasts it off into space. 

The details of this aren't too important to this talk but in the course of these twelve pages he suggests we build two of these orbs, fiddle with the quantum state in just the right way that each is simulating a black hole in the AdS world and then entangle the two in just the right way such that these two virtual black holes are connected by a wormhole.

What makes this extra crazy is that while these things are a bit unrealistic, they're not unimaginable, there are good reasons to believe that these we could, in principle do this. 

But it's gets better, because then he hits us with this diagram. To the quantum physicists in the room this is pretty normal, is a way to sketch out a sequence of quantum operations like those that might be carried out by a quantum compute or quantum pondering orb but what's this thing up here. Oh yeah that's you, we're gonna clone your quantum state into the orb, destroying you in the process, we will then send you to fall into the black hole and be transported to the other side where we will extract you and interview you about what you saw. 

OK so why am I telling you this? First I think it's funny that this arxiv paper has a better plot than interstellar but also I think it's a fun way to see why condensed matter theory can be really cool. 

Now CFTs are an example of something called a interacting quantum many body system.

explain that usually don't want to examine the full quantum many body state.

But if we do we get cool things!
